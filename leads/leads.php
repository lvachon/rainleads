Develop a social network similar to MySpace, Face book, Tagged.com, Linkd.com.  Where singers, producers musicians, hip hop artist, jazz, R&B artist can create and share their music with people around the world.


1. Create a website where country singers can up load a song he/she has created and share it with a community of country lovers.

2. Create a platform where artist can collaborate together on songs without ever being in the same location or even in the same country. For example: A Rap artist located in London will be able to upload a song and have a R&B artist from Spain can add a hook, collaborate and make a R&B and Rap song. 

3. Members will have the opportunity to express their creative talent on songs other members have posted and build from each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ideas and creative energy. 
3a. For example: I am username Darknight on the network and I have been working on a song for several weeks now however, I have no inspiration to complete the song. I can upload that song and discuss with other community members what the song is missing or what the song needs to be completed.
 
4. This website has to be in the social network format similar to MySpace, face book where a user can request friends, send email, instant message, upload photo, and search for their favorite music genre.

5. A member can upload song onto the network for everyone to see and comment on. Members can download your song with your permission and then add a verse or hook to your song.





TABS

The tabs would list music genre: Hip Hop, country music, rap, rock, jazz, alternative music, reggae, soul, blues, ect.

Country: Africa, Canada, England, Jamaica, Haiti, ect.

Studio: Members will be able to enter the studio tab and begin using a program similar to pro tools or cool edit to create their song. Once song is completed in studio tab, the user can then share it with the rest of the network for opinions or creative ideas. The song will be updated and available for the whole community to listen, comment, revise, or add hook, or verse.

I am a web developer looking to partner with a with a team. I specialize in flash animation and have done many sites for models and recording artists. My clients enjoy my skills but I would enjoy having more clients! If nothing else i can add to each clients page with a custom swf flash banner animation. I can work remotely and talk to clients over the phone...or have you relay what you need animated. Please email me back to let me know if this kind of partnership can work. For starters i can work on 1 client\'s banner animation for free, before we engage in a on going work relationship. My goal in the future would be to get 5 clients animation details told to me, at once so i can get a lump sum versus one site.

here\'s an example of my animation on myspace:

http://www.lethalbars.com/samplesite/myspace/

here\'s an example of a flash portfolio site:

http://www.lethalbars.com/samplesite/jazminebezerra/

I can do these for a little more money and I can host their domain on my unlimited hosting if they already have a domain name.

for way more money....i even can make people full cartoon movies....

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8EvEutay5c

..the sky is the limit with the things your clients want to promote and the animation tie-ins.

What I offer you in the partnership is an expansion of your reach...you do x amount of projects based on your team\'s ability to knock out the work....when you add me you can agree to more projects....you can except more money doing less work. I am open to handling multiple clients at once. Please contact me so that we may continue this dialogue. - booda

Right after that we want a place where our latest videos/blogs/articles will on the whole width of the page, like a java script that would rotate automatically,  will be, right after that we want a menu with drop downs, where we would have standard home, contact us, different categories, archives, . After that we want to have a single column style blog , and on a right side we would want place for an ad, and underneath an ad a place for latest/feature video , either one we could host on our own or from youtube, underneath that we would want to have list of latest articles, or most popular articles underneath that we might want to have a place for google adds, underneath that we would want a list of latest videos. 
Our main concern what kind of support is given after the site was created, with additional changes that might be made, after we use out revisions. (obviously I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect to get it for free and was wondering how much would it cost for additional changes) . It would be done in wordpress, the question is , how easy is it make changes to content, add additional categories and make changes that blog owners might want to make in future

The website will be a little different from the norm and will involve people writing a resume and introducing their single friend to potential daters searching the website. It will include all the usual profile stuff and uploaded pics, but it will need to have an inbox with who has written to them, hotlisted them, indicate when people were last online, when they read a message. I would also like an email to be sent to the user to notify them when any of the above occur. I would also like it to shhow who is online at that time. The aim is to make the website addictive, fun, cool and really easy to use.  
I also plan to host dating events in the destination and would like to be able to advertise/sell/update tickets online. I look forward to getting an idea of a quote to construct such a site.

I have a link sharing web site, www.boudoirphotographynetwork.com that  I started and I want to take it to the next level.

I need...

1. A blog on the front page.
2. Vendor listing by state with images for each vendor. 
3. room for paid advertising banner adds.
If you visit my current site, boudoir photography network, you will see how I have it set up. I need something slicker than a home made armature wordpress site.

I would also like to look into adding...
4. a chat room for the women/clients to show off their boudoir photos and chat about their photographer, experience etc..
5. A forum for photographers to share ideas and talk to each other. 

I do not know all that is involved in running a forum or chat room so I will need your guidance on this. I have done some reading on it and it seems like it can get very involved. I need to know if there is pre programed template  software you can install to run a chat room or forum. I have no idea I\'m still reading up on the subject and talking with people. 

After the first site launches I want to launch a second and third site exactly the same but one will be called the children\'s photography network and the other will be high school senior photography network. They will be sister sites and look exactly the same except for color change. I may try to get the vendor listing  and blog going for each site and once all three sites are up and running start a forum and chat room that all three sites will share. 
I need to be able to manage the web site by my self and not have to call you guys every time I want to add a photo or a vendor.  I have to do this in stages money is tight this year. I\'ve never seen the economy so bad. 
So give me a call or drop me an email. 
Thanks!

We are interested in developing and piloting a new child sponsorship system in Guatemala, where we currently have 7,500 children that we feed, educate and provide medical attention.  

The idea would be to develop a website where children could be selected from a database of available children, by gender, age, etc... and then sponsored by credit card for a monthly amount by individuals. 

The social network component would be adding a more robust means of communications between sponsors and the children (a facebookish-like experience?) where sponsors could see activities within their childÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s school, family, etc... and children could write to sponsors and so forth. Letters from children could be run through a translator in order to be understood by the sponsor. 

Many thoughts still need to be developed but this is the major idea we would like to explore.

My name is Lindsay and I work for NISTAC, the Technology Transfer Office for Kansas State University.  I would like to present new research that has been completed at KSU that has resulted in the filing of a patent related to social networking. We are now currently seeking potential licensees in which we feel their business interests align very well with our research. We feel our technology could be an additional improvement to your existing software.

This licensing opportunity is related to a new invention by Dr. Hsu and Dr. Aljandal out of Kansas StateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Department of Computing and Information Science entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew Method for the Optimization of Association Rule Based Data Mining.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This research has identified interestingness measures that account for itemset size imbalances providing more accurate and useful information.

If you are interested in reviewing this further, I can gladly provide a one page, non-confidential summary of this technology. My apologies if this is not the correct department to send this to; however, I would appreciate your assistance in forwarding this to the correct person. 

I look forward to hearing back regarding your interest!

But looking at e.g. the search/profile criteriaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on the big dating sites when you search profiles then there is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 different characteristics to take into consideration which makes the database programming fairly complex. Beside that you can send winks, see who been looking at your profile etc. etc. etc. etc.......
 
But if you try to think about the "keep it simple stupid" version of a dating website where you just do the following:
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢	Make profile with only 10 characteristics e.g. height, weight, hair color etc. 
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢	Write profile text 
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢	Upload photo  
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢	Then you can search profiles on the same 10 characteristics and the search will spit out a list of profiles matching the search criteriaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. 
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢	Then you can choose to email the profile(s) you find relevant to establish contact. 
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢	You can establish groups as with Facebook with individually chosen subjects. 
The above bullet points is basically the key metric of the community I\'m talking about. I\'ve learned that the source coding for this should be fairly standard.

Hence - looking at what you gusy have done in the past it seems like you would be a good fit for my idea. Most of all I need to know the potential cost I\'m signing up for. I have a presentation which describe in more details what I\'m looking for.

Hello,
I have looked through your porfolio and I am very impressed.
We are looking into having our myspace layout put in HTML Code. I have 80% of the Graphic Art done and could send it to you at any time. We just need help with positioning, table headers (background) and some other odds and ends. I have the header done, and I made a sample of what we want our myspace to look like (see link), we just need someone to bring it to life. Please let me know if you could help us out and how much it would cost.

Not only young people can use this service, as more mature people also could use this website. The website will be based around the travel industry, aimed towards one specific market group within travel, this being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Clubbing HolidaysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Every year, youngsters (not only youngsters) go on these sorts of holidays, flying and partying in resorts like San Antonio, Ayia Napa, Faliraki, Laganas, etc etc. WouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it be great if there was a social networking website that can help develop friendship before they go on these holidays, stay connected with these friends when they are home, meet up with them in the resort, at the clubs, at the beach... whatever the circumstances, this can happen. Facebook is widely used around the world for keeping in touch with friends you already know. Sometimes people go on clubbing holidays, meet people but will never meet them again. WouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it be great if there was a place where they can stay connected, and not have to find these people on thousands and thousands of pages, like on Facebook. This social networking/micro blogging website will be aimed at this. The users will have their own profiles, be able to upload there images, create ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“tweet-likeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ messages and also join groups for the resorts they are going to/or have been to. 
These groups I have mentioned will include all of the major destinations for clubbing holidays. The users can join these groups, and talk to people who are going the same date as them on holiday, speak to people who have been there before and can get great advice from these people. The whole aim of the website is to create friendship before they go on holidays. They could meet people in these groups who are going on holiday, to the same resort as them, so that when they are over there, they can meet with these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“new friendsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and then be able to stay in contact with them. Clubbing holidays, as everyone is aware, are a way for people to go on holiday to get drunk, party until early hours of the morning, and sometimes try to get ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“luckyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. We want to be in partnership with companies like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“DrinkawareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“NHSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ etc... to make sure people are also aware of the safety of these holidays. Going back to the groups, users can also upload photos of their holidays in these groups, and then people within them groups can tag themselves in the photos, that way they have more photos of themselves on their profile.
This website will also look at groups aimed towards DJs and Nightclubs. These groups can offer users information about the clubs, upcoming events and possible discounts/offers. Also DJs can have groups of their own on this website, where users can access these pages and can see when the DJs are going to be in the nightclubs, what dates, what sort of event it is etc etc.
The website will not only focus on the users, but it will also promote leading nightclubs abroad, over to the UK about the events that they will be holding. When the users log in, they will be redirected to their home profile. This is the users main portal. For example: If I was a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and I was booked to go to Ibiza in the summer, I will then search for Ibiza or San Antonio (or any of the other party resorts). This will then redirect me to search results, where I can choose to join the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ibiza ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ San AntonioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ group. This group will then allow me to interact with other members of the website, who are going or have been to San Antonio. They can talk privately about when they are going. As a website, we will make sure know one discusses any personal information, and we will make sure the users know this before they sign up to an account. If a group of my ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“budsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ joined up to this website, and we were all going to Ibiza, we could all join the group (as I said above) and speak with people who are going the same time as us, in one big group (not like on Facebook, where itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a one to one). 
Where It asks "Available Budget", I am flexible as to price, I want the best, so give me the quote you think for this website, not based around the \'Available Budget\' margin (if that makes sense).
I am from the UK, as you could of guessed.

We also want for people to be able to give status updates and connect to facebook/twitter/myspace.

Finally, we need to be able to serve ads on the site...300x250, 728x90 & 120x600, as well as maintain a database of users to send email blasts to.

Can you please give us a rough estimate of what a network like that would run? Doesn\'t have to be concrete, just a ballpark quote. Also, can you give us an average time for delivery?

It could very easily grow organically in the search engines like mushrooms. 

My thought is something like a combination of features from the following sites:
 
HouseLogic.com for content
Welcomewagon.com & Coupons.com for local coupons & info
360directories.com for local area info
ActiveRain.com for professional multi-user blogs & profiles
Craigslist.com for classifieds (free and paid)
Trulia.com/voices for consumer / professional interaction
YellowPages.com for local business directories
 
Kind of like iVillage.com but for the real estate industry. I envision networks in each city with a local real estate agent/broker being the webmaster/moderator for that city.

	I am an aspiring author needing 1) graphics and illustrations 2) a website and 3) a logo in that order of importance. The purpose is to market a work which I will have published via Amazon Kindle and to attract enough readers so I can show agents and publishers in my subsequent manuscript submissions that I am serious about my writing career and have an established following. 
	My idea for an illustration is simple, basically a cover art depicting a scene from my story. As for a website, I envision having the standard: information about the author, a blog, a galleries page, a page where I can post free stories, upcoming projects page, and the current story being sold or published (linking them to where they can purchase). Additional elements that would be nice to have would be a comments section with log-in asking users for certain demographic information (so I know who my market audience is) and maybe a donations link on the free stories page. Lastly, with regards to the logo, I would like to establish a brand imageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½something that reflects me and my style. 
	Obviously, these are just concepts, and I am flexible with whatever recommendations Pearson might make. However, price is also an important element in the equation. Thus, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to get a clear breakdown of how much each of the three services cost. In this manner, I can prioritize my spending should I not be able to purchase all three concurrently. 
	I look forward to your reply. Thank you.

We need to make social network like Facebook with at least 4 different languages. with live chat and over 11 applications. Applications are like online restaurant, business communities, students communities, online games etc. Approximately how much it will cost and what time will be needed to complete and host. Service must include design and technical service and bug prevention service too.

It will also offer both well known and lesser known home goods purveyors with a context rich environment for showcasing their goods and being selected for the various elements of the design.
To be clear, this is not a "do-it-yourself" model (though the site will have lots of great content, and preferably paid and free content areas), but rather one that collects information (in both survey and graphic form) about a customer\'s decorating/design challenge.  Based on the information, their need and solution is filtered (i.e room dimensions, general style determined, color, existing furniture to fit into design, etc.) and sent to an Interior Design professional who "tweaks" and perfects the filtered outcome, and ultimately produces a "Room Map" - a road map for decorating a room or space, which will be available in a printed form and via an uploadable i-phone application (or whatever you recommend).  I envision a place where users can view other people\'s decorated rooms, network with others, etc.  The consumer profile  for this service network is primarily women between 25 and 65, educated (college or higher), VERY busy, social, dual income households, incomes between $90K and $500K.
I\'m interested in both your site/network building capabilities and your marketing/branding capabilities.  I\'d also be interested in building the functionality in stages, building the revenue streams in sequence.  
I am in the early stages of seeking some additional funding, and would like to understand how you work, what you recommend, and the associated costs - so the "available budget" could change considerably.
In the end I\'m looking for a new media partner that I can work with for the initial build and beyond.

Paintballing is a sport comprised of two teams who try to eliminate each other by shooting each other with paintballs. The game can be played in various modes: capture the flag, elimination, and territories, to name a few.
    
Unfortunately, there is a problem with paintballing.  Currently, paintballing is very unorganized.  People like to form teams with their friends.  However, there are few leagues available for teams and no place to organize them.  I have discovered that people simply show up at a paintballing facility with a couple friends and hope there is another team waiting to play against them.

My website would give paintball teams a place to list their information by providing them their own team page. They would also have the ability to contact other teams in their area. They could arrange dates, times, and locations for their skirmishes. The site could also allow people to start their own leagues in their area. Teams nearby who are registered on the site could join the league.  All of this could also be used for the sport of airsofting, a similar sport that uses plastic bb\'s instead of paintballs.  Once the site is developed, I thought that I could charge people and/or teams a monthly fee (maybe $5 to $10 per person or $30 to $40 for a ten member team) to register on the site.  I could also sell advertising for paintball gear and other things related to paintballing or airsoft guns.

The site would be pretty much like http://paintball-players.org/ There would be a few adjustment to make it more user friendly and have more features.

We\'d like to have a feature video at the top of the page mixed in with the header that is an introduction to the band. Just under there we want our separate photos featured with our main twitter feed just underneath that. 

As for other features, we\'d like there to be a weekly video blog section that we will update every week with a new video. The myspace show calendar and a online store section is needed. I think thats about it as far as sections and features. Fairly basic page, we really would like it to look like a collage from top to bottom rather than have a collage header, then structured body. So if we could have elements of live shots that fade in here and there along the side or inbetween texts or sections. We would like it to look more smooth, with yellows, reds and blues as if it was stage with the lights shining. When you see our files it will make more sense. 

This should suffice for now.

*Multiple Friend add error (can add friends multiple times and appear multiple times)
*Deleting Friends(errors out and keeps loading)
*VIP paypal fix( it appears to be a coding problem on the site because it fully transactions and does the money on paypal so the paypal embed code works, honestly I would rather use a subscription code but my developers insisted it would work.
*Lounge placement( the group chat doesn\'t show who is online, nor is the chat facing right side up also the list of the lounges doesnt show it side by side in a list.
*photo resizing (some profile pictures are stretched out I am looking to have them resized somehow so they don\'t look deformed.
Those are the errors I found. As far as designing I am looking at these updates:
*a smaller (japan and worldwide logo and underneath a small news feed or just scrolling messages for the admin.
*Profile users being able to change colors of their view to different colors.
*Also would like to have embed video support for all pages 
*Deleted blogs,forums, are still showing on user profiles

Anyway, I want to make a social network for pregnant women, around the world (eventually), and call it Belly Friends.
Site would let users make a profile (both a basic profile and a paid profile) 

I would like users to be able to find each other based on their due date, preexisting conditions, type of pregnancy etc. so im assuming users would first set up a detailed profile. 

features i would want on site:
-member on member chat
-open chat rooms based on topic
-forum
-possibly live video chat

basic facebook style profiles with public info + private info 
pictures, lifestyle etc, but also with main points like : due date, sex of baby, twins?, etc.

users would add other users, be able to send virtual gifts to pregnant moms, send "belly rubs, belly kisses" etc. 

you guys seem to be the place for me and i am currently seeking investors because there is no way i can afford 30k for this right now.  Please give me some type of idea as to where i stand price wise. thanks for your time

Let me know what can be done to update the site. See some of the features we need as stated below.

1. We need a social networking site modelled after facebook with about the same features.
 
2. We also want to include a feature whereby prospective members gets limited access   for 48 hours during which their photo will be screened through voting by members. Full membership should be only possible after the photo as acquired up to 51% of the vote cast.
 
3. We also need you to create advert columns within the member area.This should be a dynamic one whereby third party users can add adverts just by filling a form and paying(something like the facebook advert format).
 
4. The users front page(dashboard) should display links like messages,search members,  
 friendlist, Events etc(adopt facebook as a model).

5. We also need a .html homepage that will include a login form that posts to Login.php(for  
  instance).

6. We need avery simple hompage with a particular touch of african beauty(not necessaryly humans, maybe nature).

7. Strong emphasis on privacy and the option of hiding age,contact details.Restriction on    
   photo viewing.

8. photo contest platform for members to select the most beautiful member through electronic voting.
 
Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.

Thanks for taking the time to review this request; we are excited to hear back from you.  My group is in the process of collecting early-stage estimates (primarily feasibility assessments, given budget constraints) for the build of a social networking site.  We are in early stages but still looking to commit in the late July/early August timeframe.  Our initial (6-month) development (and development-related services) budget is capped at $20k.  Our goal is to get as much of the following accomplished with that budget:
 
*Logo creation to support the business concept
*Customizable user profiles (including photos and ability to indicate a primary location)
*Search for other users by location and other attributes (name, etc.)
*Two classes of user (businesses and consumers), including the potential to charge a special class or type of user in the future
*Allow users to track activity of other users in their network
*Groups for communicating between users (e.g. forums and shared events)
*Paid advertisements (links within the network and to external websites)
*Search engine optimization
*â€œCalendars of eventsâ€
*Upload photos (does NOT need to upload video)
*Community-based reviews of other members (incl. the generation of a â€œscoreâ€ or â€œratingâ€)
*Framework to allow for the future creation of plug-ins or apps for the platform
 
At this point, weâ€™d like to get a very rough assessment of how far our 6-month budget would take us if we choose to work with Pearse Street.  We are also interested in learning more about your software licensing terms.  We will be happy to share additional details as necessary for you to give us budget guidance (and do fully recognize that your early projections may change as you learn more).  
 
As part of the process, we are also considering firmsâ€™ abilities to support our initiative beyond the earliest launch (and size of investment necessary on our end).  Here are our primary future considerations:
 
*Mobile browser format (very basic â€“ just a link to the app or continue to main website)
*Mobile apps
*Custom plug-ins (e.g. visual representation of social network)
*Flickr feeds
*User blogs (or integration of existing blogs)
 
Thanks again!

I am interesting into developing a social network that is almost exactly like Facebook but with the following differences. I am just inquiring about a ball park figure. I would especially like to know the minimum a project like this would cost. My intention is to seek investors based on the ballpark figure you provide.

1) Creating an Event is not limited to your network. Members can find events within their zip code.

1.1)	Events show on a Main calendar and can be set as a recurring event for dates specified by the event creator. See: http://www.vitopix.com/calendar2.php

1.2)	Members can choose what type of events they want to see on their default calendar view and but can also add or deselect specifications at will without changing the default settings. 

2) Members can find others based on their zipcode and information entered into the content fields.

3) A selection of 1,000 templates/themes to choose from designed by your team, but members cannot write their own codes in the content fields.

4) No Apps

5) No Ads

6) Updates can be synced with Facebook and Twitter.

7) System automatically suggests friends based on the initial interests and information entered in one\'s profile according to their zip code. 

8) Ability to upload Videos and documents.

9) Applicable nationally across the US with the potential to expand globally. This is specifically in reference to accommodating to different languages and geographical data.

I hope I provided enough information for you to generate a quote.

Ballpark Quote: Minimum - Maximum. 

Ballpark Turn Around Time: Minimum - Maximum.

Thank you so much for you assistance and timely response. 


Regards,

My name is Lauren Stockner and I\'d like to request a quote from you. I apologize for this being so vague but the idea I\'m trying to create is not protected yet so this is as detailed as I can be. I\'m trying to develop a social networking site. 

Similar to Myspace, there will be a profile page, search page, message boards, and a home page. On each users profile page, there will be templates to fill in and a section to upload basic information and photographs. Each profile page will also have a section to add comments, like on a Myspace profile.You will also be able to add users as friends (just like Myspace and Facebook).

Like I said, I know this is vague but people will be able to fill out an unlimited number of "templates" and I would need a program that would connect the text in these templates to other templates with the same text as well as in the search page. I would also need a "tagging" feature like Facebook has. How much money would a program like that cost to create and implement? Are these one time fees plus random maintenance fees?

Another question I have is that I have designs in mind and I\'m wondering how much it would cost for one of your designers to implement the design. It\'s pretty basic, I designed everything easily in Microsoft paint so I\'d imagine it wouldn\'t be insanely complicated.

My last question is about hosting. After buying the domain name, would I register with any hosting company or does it have to a specific one capable of all of these features. i would hope this would grow within a year or so to thousands of users and continue from there. I understand that this information is not a lot for you to work with and a lot of my questions will depend on the details but if you could answer me as best as you can with a cost I would really appreciate it, even if you tell me a wide range it could be.

Thanks for your help,

I would like to obtain a quote for the design and development of a social network site aimed specifically at doctors in the EU. The site will be available to registered doctors only and will need a way to verify them before they have full site access. 

The aim of the website is to be a good looking, fresh and clean site which allows medical doctors to share optimal patient treatment strategies, discuss interesting medical case studies, take part in research, discuss concerns over safety of therapy, take part in medical education, be kept up to date about industry developments and meetings and keep in contact with friends and make new acquaintances. Users will need their own profile pages which should let them express themselves fully e.g. by adding youtube, face book, my page, images, text, work and educational history.......

The CMS system needs to be robust and allow the content of the site change regularly, we also need content which changes â€“ based on AJAX or an RSS feed which changes without user interaction. Friends should be able to group and the users would be able to define the groups â€“ like linkedin and facebook allow user created groups â€“ complete with group administrators etc. We need the site to be application rich e.g. Twitter tracker

We need users to be able to import their profiles from other social networking sites e.g. facebook, linkedin. We need it to be super EASY to communicate with other users - with multiple communication opportunities all over every page, mobile support (Iphone, ipod/ipad and blackberry). We also need to make it easy to pull other people into discussions. We donâ€™t want to overwhelm users so they need to be able to filter what they see. We want to make it easy to find things on the website so multiple search options are key. We want to promote Interesting Content From Friends. We want to show the users what their friends are doing. From the moment someone logs in, they should be able to see what their friends have been doing, posting, and otherwise promoting. 

Photo displayâ€™s of users and membership directories also crucial. 

We want to give users the opportunity to explore what the site is all about before they sign up. By seeing for example people they already know on the site. So the home page needs to include signing up, taking a tour, or exploring content.

We need to inform new visitors of the sites purpose right on the home page.

It should be It Easy To Find Friends, so the site needs to Let users search by email, school, company, name, and other identifying factors.

The site will accept advertising and will need an interface where users can take part in polls and questionnaires. Users will also be mailed a regular newsletter. 

It will be aimed at a highly educated but internet novice/intermediate audience so the interface needs to logical and easy to use. Users will need to be able to share comments with other users and non users â€“ all the latest web 2.0 gadgets are needed e.g. add to facebook, RSS feeds, link to youtube video etc. We need an industry level site.

Its very simple, but functional. gaining a pretty good following for a forum. 

I did all this with my own knowledge so far but there are some things i need help with. 

I would like to add a couple things to user profiles. 
If you look at the site Athlinks.com, it somehow automatically fetches users endurance race results by searching online and auto post them to the users profile. way beyond my abilities. 

also there is a section on my site where users post the miles they ran for the day. i would like those miles to auto post to facebook if the users had an account. only the posts from that section and nothing else. 

one final thing, i am wondering about a decent facebook bridge. the free ones available on vbulletin.org are buggy and flawed, i want a straing flawless bridge, where users can sign in with their facebook account automatically to my site. i dont know how this would affect current usernames and passwords on my site but im sure there is a way around it. 

i am willing to put some money into my site to make it great, but i do like the simplicity of it now. 
i think these three things will take my site to the next level.

This Brendon who called yesterday with regards to building my site. The site is based on creating a User name with Profile Pictures.

The focus is for the front page to show users that are online close in proximity to you.
(The logo or page should feature a radar screen)

User can add the fallowing information to profile: Hobbies, Interests, Music, Create Events(optional)

Should be a great way to meet new people that are around and make new friends by relating to them and finding things in common.



Going quite basic for now don\'t have alot of money to invest at this point but will after the site gets its ad revenue. Still have a lot of ideas for more websites and improvements to my site Whoisaround.com. I know this site will be a great success because of its simplicity and the site basically explains what it is all about by the name.

My site idea is a social network allowing caregivers and maids the ability to fill out their profiles on this site to make themselves available for the \\\'lucrative\\\' private hire jobs. Also there will be tools available on the site to do background checks, insure, verify certificates, and hire on the books with an online payroll tool. These tools will be set up specifically as one program for the private hire employer, very user friendly. 
Social workers and discharge planners at hospitals will begin referring clients here because of the cheap alternative to private pay, while making it easy to protect themselves. As the word gets around through various help wanted listings, high numbers of workers will want to fill out the profile. The profiles are free to fill out and free to browse. The service tools are fee based. Advertising is fee based.

Weâ€™re a US company with offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and San Diego. I work with a lot of programmers and designers down here that work at far lower rates than their American counterparts with the same level of design quality.

I\\\'ve been looking at your portfolio and I like a lot of your work. My firm is growing now and it is easy for us to hire local talent that is very good--and cheap. Below you can see my portfolio site as well as our affiliate site (New Wave).  I think you can see that my firm\\\'s design quality is on par with your own, and I think we could help each other out in the long run. We are also very busy sometimes, and it would help to have a place where we could send work if need be.

I wanted to see if you have any clients or work you need help with for right now, as well as if we could send clients your way if we get too busy. We can do a home + 1 subpage for $300, and of course anything else up through the entire development and hosting of a site. We also have in-house SEO specialists. Let me know if you would be interested and we can discuss. Hope to hear from you soon.

I am looking at starting a social networking site with roots in the music industry. The basic idea is for musicians to be able to broadcast themselves from anywhere in the world playing their music via a live stream on the web. I came across the following site which is similar: www.thestage.tv
On my website musicians and fans would have their own profiles, much like myspace where they can interact with one another, upload their music, photos etc... and advertise their live broadcasts (shows). These broadcasts will be accessible from the home page. The idea is in early stages of development but I\\\'m just trying to get an idea of how much I\\\'d be looking at spending to get the website developed and up and running. Many thanks for your time.

Nice that I found your service of social web development. 


My Social web idea is about Health-related which benefit 5 group of people.
1. Health-related information receiver (fed to their email with prefered frequency) :
2. Health-releted content feeder
3. Affiliate (traffic builder) : 
4. Product supplier
5. Web owner itself

Below is the idea and brief description to help you understand my web to be developped.

The concept is that 
With the objective, to be health-concious, update information on cure, treatment, be exposed to service offered, sharing by other people.
People can register to receive the health-related content in any specific category , fed to their inbox with prefered frequency.
It\\\'s a kind of long-term disease-prevention life style.

Health-releted content feeder is expected to be people with good-will, Nutrition supplement company, Network marketer.
Content receiver can give rating in many aspect to the article they just read.
Rating score will affect the distribution algorithm of the content.
Content owner can also get sale commission when the people read their article and instantly purchase the product from the web.
Content can be in any form of media : text, audio, video, picture, or all of them combined

Affiliate will have sale commission when the people they bring to the web (tied with affiliate from the registration stage) purchase the product from the web.

Product supplier : any free member must upgrade their status (pay some fee / year) to be a product supplier.
then their product advertising box will appear at the bottom area of article content page.
Article content page is shown when content receiver click \\"Read more\\" from the brief content (2-3 line) appeared in the email.

The web itself have revenue from fee (free member upgrade to be product-supplier), ads banner , google adsense, 
Free member can play any role : content receiver, content feeder, affilier (build traffic), but the product supplier.

This is a brief concept of my web...which when develop it to become reality will need more detail in many many aspects.
So far I have detail at many area of my web already.

Let me know if you need more information from me.

Could you please estimate the Cost ?
Please explain....Once we agree to develop it...how will it be done interntionally.(I am in Thailand) ?
I hope your team experience and many well-developped modules that you already have will lower the cost of development.

Purchasing will be similar to iTunes style. Registered ( logged in ) visitors can purchase photoset or video from a profile (s) without filling up cc information each visit.  They will be also able to purchase an access to whole profile (s) for a day, week, month etc.
At this time, we are choosing a processing company able to handle such a billing structure. I have found your site on the internet and I\\\'m very impressed by the type of work you do.

The basic idea is that the kids will have their own individual pages (perhaps wiki pages) that list their interests, talents, blogs, etc. And from this page, projects will be initiated and worked on by collaboration with a free flowing network of college students. The projects will simply be a product of whatever the kids\\\' interests are. But the primary focus will be creative expression in some form or another. The primary purpose, at the end of the day, is to expose the inner city kids to a world and thoughts that! may be outside of their own, and vice versa. And by doing that, maybe some unique content will be created. Anyway, that\\\'s the somewhat half-baked summary. Of course, I\\\'ve got a million other thoughts related to this project that are probably as scattered as the above summary unfortunately. But my hope is that, assuming you are in a position to assist, you can help me flush out these ideas in bit more linear fashion. And, as a first step, I was hoping to meet at some point later next week if at all possible.  My hope is to be able to build a prototype within a 5-10k budget if at all possible.

 I have in mind a cross between Roseanne Leaton attractive fun look www.roseannaleaton.com and the clean Apple type look with flashes of colour. With hypnosis, CREDIBILITY is key and therefore one of the most important focusses of this site. Professional and establishing my credibility whilst giving enough for the visitor to feel comfortable with me - thus the video presenter.

On a more involved level do you also have experience in CRM EMAIL MARKETING campaigns etc as I think I need to bear this in mind in relation to my site and perhaps that this is integral, eg sign up for free welcome pack and gift, then able to use info to send progressively changing discount offers etc to finally convert to a sale etc

Perhaps the KEY focus should be SEO, coming up early in google for stop smoking, give up smoking, smoking hypnosis, smoking hypnotherapy, paul mckenna smoking, allen carr etc etc

Including the  FRIEND-A-GORILLA campaign into the WWW.UGANDAWILDLIFE.ORG website.
 
Currently the WWW.UGANDAWILDLIFE.ORG website is running on  a shared hosted  server as opposed to the FRIEND-A-GORILLA site which is on a dedicated  server. 
The FRIEND-A-GORILLA site is programmed in .NET and yet the WWW.UGANDAWILDLIFE.ORG site is on LAMP with a JOOMLA CMS(Content  Management System)

Combining the two would need to  
1.	Upgrade the Hosting of WWW.UGANDAWILDLIFE.ORG site to a dedicated server bearing in mind that the FRIEND-A-GORILLA campaign gets a lot of traffic per day (about 150 hits)
2.	Cloning the FRIEND-A-GORILLA site and converting it to LAMP and making it a subdomain of the WWW.UGANDAWILDLIFE.ORG site
3.	Maintaining the FRIEND-A-GORILLA domain names which include www.friendagorilla.org, www.friendagorilla.com, www.befriendagorilla.com, and www.befriendagorilla.org  on a cheaper Shared hosting and linking them to the new FRIEND-A-GORILLA site on the subdomain at the WWW.UGANDAWILDLIFE.ORG site.
4.	Redesigning the WWW.UGANDAWILDLIFE.ORG site to have a more WEB 2 look with Social networking Linkages to Facebook and Twitter.
Specifically for the FRIEND-A-GORILLA site the following have to be done
1)	Host the FRIEND-A-GORILLA website on a dedicated Server as a subdomain of www.ugandawildlife.org
2)	Redevelop and redesign the FRIEND-A-GORILLA website with secure and upgradable Content Management System in either Joomla Magento CMS
3)	Migrate current files and database to new server and maintain linkage with befriended Gorillas and current fans on Facebook and twitter
4)	Develop applications including but not limited to: 
a.	Social Networking apps
b.	Blogging 
c.	Cause measurement
d.	E-commerce shopping cart 
â€¢	Gorilla friending for rest of the world
â€¢	SMS friending for East African Community
â€¢	Merchandising
e.	Advertising Banners
f.	E-Newsletter
g.	Membersâ€™/fansâ€™ Photo gallery
h.	Geo tracking
i.	Virtual tracking
5)	Optimize search engine  and marketing capability

Wiki me is a social network that allows friends to create their own wiki pages and invite friends to come and wiki their pages. 
Personal Wiki Profiles â€“
Each registered user will have their own personal wiki page about who they are. This page will be broken down into categories such as their Bio, accomplishments, major events in their lives, memories, funny stories, photos, videos, etc. Friends will be invited to wiki each of their friendâ€™s profile, adding info to the page. The functionality should behave he same way as Wikipedia.
Photos that are tagged with a userâ€™s name will automatically show up in the photos section of their wiki profile as well as videos. 
Tag Clouds â€“ Within each wiki profile page, a personality section will show a tag cloud representing a personâ€™s personality created by their friends. Friends will be invited to tag a person with keywords similar to tagging a blog post.
RIP Wiki Pages for friends that have passed â€“
Each registered user will have the option off creating a wiki page for their deceased friends. Again, this page will operate the same way as the personal wiki profiles.
Non-Personal Wiki pages â€“
Users will have the option of creating wiki pages on anything under the sun and have their friends edit them. These pages will obviously be about topics that they their network of friends share. 
Network Based Wiki Pages â€“
Users will have the option of creating their own networks similar to Facebook groups and create wiki pages in that particular network.
There will be two default networks that everyone will be apart of, rather networks that will be default networks. These two networks are college networks and regional networks.
Each user will be required to enter their profile info containing where they reside and what college they attend. 
College Networks â€“ Once a person enters what college they go to, they will automatically be placed into that college network with all others who attend that school. Each person apart of this network will now have the option of creating wiki pages on that network about their school sharing info amongst students.
Regional Networks â€“ Works exactly the same way as college networks.
Status Updates â€“
Users will be able to post any random thoughts they have, upload photos, share articles, etc. The difference is that they will be a requirement to tag each update with keywords describing what the update is about. As a consequence, all activity will be categorized. Photos will be categorized. All photos uploaded by friends will be grouped together with everyone elseâ€™s photos on that network creating a shared photo album amongst friends. Example:
Jane uploads a wedding photo and tags it with the keyword wedding photo. All photos amongst friends who have tagged their photos as wedding photos will be shown on a single page under the photos section. Users will have the option of searching the site for photos using keywords. Also there will be a tag cloud representing all of the tags that have been used for uploading photos. 
Tag clouds will be used as a method for finding info as well as a search feature.
The idea is that by tagging updates, photos, etc., friends will be able to view all of their friends photos on 1 page by category creating photo album.
This tagging process will work the same way for status updates. The main feature though will be the ability to see the most popular conversation and updates amongst friends that is those updates that have gotten the most comments. The popular comments will be able to be filtered by day, week, month year, etc. Updates will also be able to be shown by the most recent updates displaying just like the Facebook newsfeed.
Friends will be given the option of tagging each friendâ€™s status anonymously with keywords describing what they think of their thoughts as:
Funny, Boring, interesting, like, dislike, who cares, etc. Again users will be able to see the funniest; most interesting, most popular updates by searching are using the resulting tag cloud from their updates.

(3) A mobile site that will allow non-members and members to use the site from mobile phones (4) The ability for members to send messages to others anonymously (5) Apps which facilitate usage of the site when not at a computer. Apps, if possible, would include these unusual functionalities: (a) the ability to enter an SSN by voice, having the voice converted to text and (b) the ability to send voice memos instead of text, similar to voicemail.

on the medical side 
doctors will be able to create profiles of each of their patients
upload data from the doctor\\\'s visits onto profile 
have an online medical book like the one used locally to update 
fequently asked questions
area ask their doctors questions  

on the social side 
1. Create a profile page to diplay pics of their children/family
2. classifieds for baby/toddler products 
3. updates on where your baby should be for pregnant women and newborns 
4. advertising 

the idea is to have a place where you can shar your pics with your friends and family overseas specifically for your children. along with that a place for people to talk, buy clothes, advertise goods and services, and the like. the midical part is to keep trak of your child online so that even if you lose the hard copy you still have documentation of your child\\\'s current health.

TV SOCIAL NETWORK WHEN FACEBOOK & GMAIL MEET TV OVERVIEW

SAY a new type of Social Network where the users can interact and contribute to Live and broadcast TV shows.

OBJECTIVE
Create a solid, multilingual and modular Social Network system - site that gives the members the ability to not only socialize but to generate TV content as well as have their SAY Live on TV about topics they really care about.

OUTLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING
( Closely based on the workings of FACEBOOK )

1. NON MEMBERS - ( Unlike FACEBOOK )
Can view the entire sites contents but cannot interact or contribute until registered. If they click on anything that requires membership they are prompted with a pop up registration form.
2. REGISTRATION - ( Like FACEBOOK ) Any one can become a member by completing a very simple classic style registration
form.
3. MEMBERSHIP - ( Like FACEBOOK )
A member gets the following :
- PROFILE - All the standard profile features. Simple, intuitive, clean.
- FRIENDS - Members can become friends of other members or SHOWS ( groups )
- ARCHIVE - Member data storage ( 100 meg storage limit )
â€¢ PHOTOS | VIDEOS | MUSIC | DOCS - ( Like FACEBOOK ) â€¢ BACKUP - Download the archive to your computer
- WHALL / BLOG ( Like FACEBOOK + WORDPRESS )
â€¢ ARTICLE STYLE POSTS - The ability to make Wordpress like articles ( with photos, videos, paragraphs and frames ) through the post editor.
â€¢ VIDEO POST - Web cam recording to server ( Limit 30 seconds ) ( Like www.pidsumky. 1tv.com.ua ) Add video recordings to your blog posts.
- Pre recorded Video Upload to server ( Limit 3 minutes ) - Video Embedding ( From YouTube or other video sites. )
- EMAIL - An email address based on members user name.
â€¢ BASIC EMAIL - ( Like GMAIL ) Limited inbox size. â€¢ VIDEO EMAIL (VMAIL) - WEB CAM RECORDING - In a pop up window recorder ( Limit
1 minute - 10 PER DAY - each message has a 7 DAY LIFESPAN )
Webcam Recorder Options - RECORD | PLAY | PAUSE | DELETE ( records webcam video to site server then embeds it in a branded video player into the email )
+ UPLOAD VIDEO ( upload a small video via the sites server to be embedded into the body of the email in a branded player )
+ EMBED VIDEO LINK ( Like YouTube in GMAIL )
+ STANDARD FILE ATTACHMENTS
* VIDEO REPLY - When a recipient of a video email wants to video reply to the Vmail he can do so but clicking reply on the embedded video player that brings up a registration form.
- CHAT (CHAT BAR) - ( Like FACEBOOK + GMAIL CHAT / VIDEO CHAT )
- Text chat - Voice Chat ( Like GMAIL - SKYPE ) - Video Chat ( Like GMAIL - SKYPE ) - Conference calls ( SKYPE ) *
- COMMENTS - ( Like FACEBOOK )
- Text comments - Voice comments - Video comments (WWW.1TV.COM.UA) RECORD | UPLOAD | EMBED
- MEMBER RATINGS ( Unlike FACEBOOK ) Members get ratings for contributing content to sites SHOWS - GROUPS as well as by
participating in LIVE TV shows.
- 4 STAR RATING SYSTEM - after the 4th star member gets ( CART BLNACE - SHOW ADMIN assigns a star after members content appears on TV or a member
participates in a LIVE show

- PENALTY POINT SYSTEM | YELLOW CARD | RED CARD
- PRIVACY SETTINGS - ( Like FACEBOOK ) + FILTERING BY MEMBER RATING
- GROUPS - ( Like FACEBOOK ) also will be known as ( SHOWS & EPISODES )

Each group is like a limited virtual member profile that gets linked to the producer-admin of the group.
This profile dose not have its own email ( gets linked to the email address of the producer ) and has limited data space.

There are 2 types of groups - shows on the site.

TYPE 1 : SITE GROUPS - TV SHOWS
These are groups based on real TV shows created by sites admins that are controlled by the site and cannot be edited by members but can only be contributed to.
Each SHOW has sub groups called EPISODES they are created to coincide with each TV shows appearance by the ( admin - producer )

SHOW + EPISODE = VIRTUAL MEMBER PROFILE ( DUAL PROFILE PIC ) ( UNLIMITED DATA +/- 100 GIG ) - CONTROLLED BY ADMIN - PRODUCER

TYPE 2: MEMBER GROUPS ( EPISODES )
Members can only create new EPISODES - Groups that are either based on the existing site SHOWS or are related to sites key interest topics e.g. (SPORT - HEALTH - RELIGION etc. )
MEMEBR EPISODE = VIRTUAL MEMBER PROFILE ( DUAL PROFILE PIC ) ( Limit 10 EPISODES X 250 MEG LIMIT ) - CONTROLLED BY MEMBER - PRODUCER
NO NEW EMAIL - EMAIL BASED ON PRODUCER
After creating a new EPISODE group you receive a welcome mail - message instructions : with all the details and contact to the SHOW - TOPIC admin - producer.
SHOW - EPISODE appearance
- ADMIN - PRODUCER PIC + GROUP PIC - DESCRIPTION - CURRENT TOPIC - DATE
LIVE - MEMBERS / FRIENDS ON AIR | SOON ON AIR
A Newsfeed like section - tab, active when TV shows are showing: can be set to show any members or just your friends that are currently â€œ on air â€œ Similar to friends online feature of FACEBOOK but also giving an opportunity to go on the LIVE SHOW page and contribute.

LIVE TV - ( Like 1TV.COM.UA ) The LIVE TV is a unique feature. It resembles the dynamic FACEBOOK WALL or the BBC
live coverage feed, where users can visit view and contribute.
Its a dynamically updated page that becomes active when the sites TV shows are on the air.
It has both a public view and a producer view ( interface )
â€¢ Public view is a live wall view where the member can see the dynamic feed of the SHOW and also add and contribute his
â€¢ The producer view is an interface where he can interact ( chat ) with members and select them or their content to use on the show in real time.

The BACKEND requires to have all the classic social network site management tools as well as an in-depth analytics section similar to google analytics but much simpler.
The KEY aspect of this website is the video ( webcam ) interaction - posting element, this needs to be rock solid and has to be very streamline and deploy the most up to date technology.
The LIVE TV web cam interaction feature is also vital but will be scheduled as phase 2 of development but also requires to be quoted on. We have testing facilities and a number of experts on this topic and will provide all the assistance necessary during the development and testing phase.

However, I\\\'m not to comfortable in discussing the exact details pertaining to this project at this moment prior to not having a binding NDA (nondisclosure agreement) between us. I\\\'m sure that you can understand my position. With that said I\\\'m sure that you can advise me on how we can best move forward regarding this concern of mine, and if not I have a NDA that I can send over for you guys to look over and sign. But I can give you some general descriptions for now so that you can at least have a basic idea about what I\\\'m trying to have developed. I want my website to be more of a content exchange site a s appose to just being like your typical social networking site like the facebooks and twitters of the world.  This site will be a place for people to exchange content rather than just being a place to talk nonsense. This won\\\'t  only be a place where people mainly talk about themselves or each other in a nonproductive fashion. For example, who cares when you got up today and what you ate. This info means nothing to me. My content networking website will provide users with info that they view as being meaningful and useful to them.  Again, I can go into much further details once we have a binding NDA between us. So hopefully with this basic info you will be able to provide me with a ballpark estimate as to what a project such as this may cost me.

The website itself is quite sophisticated, yet includes service offerings like Craigslist, profiles and rankings like eBay, and private messaging like Facebook. Most of these features are functional but have a number of flaws that need to be fixed. A bulk of the work, in this project would be design oriented and would hopefully increase the siteâ€™s ease of use, flow, and appeal. 

The site itself is a Ruby on Rails application that connects to a MySQL database in the backend. We are looking to get a quote for the following tasks:

â€¢	Edit the CSS style sheet to create a consistent aesthetically pleasing theme throughout the site 
â€¢	Create new buttons, icons, and containers that would make the site look neater, organized, and consistent
â€¢	Develop a Forum with Categories for specific locations, and Subcategories for each of these locations. 
â€¢	Install a Wiki on the site
â€¢	Fix any flaws in the current Ruby code and remove any bugs that may arise
â€¢	Update the ranking system to include a five star ranking/review style for some site content, and a Readit/Digg (up-vote/down-vote) style ranking system for other site content
â€¢	Install Google Adsense banners on the site
â€¢	Install a Donation feature on the site
â€¢	Most of the site involves classifieds style postsâ€”we need to make sure that a flagging system is in place

Iâ€™m a co-founder of a newly formed non-profit, have a degree in Information Systems, and oversee the technical development of the company. We hired a private contractor to complete this work and have just recently ended our contract with her because we werenâ€™t pleased with the outcome to date. This project has a strict time guideline that is non-negotiable, and we need a contractor who can guarantee its completion and deployment by January 21st. Because of our last experience, we are now looking for a web developer who is professional, highly knowledgeable, can understand our vision, and do whatever it takes to create a user friendly, fully functional, and aesthetically pleasing website. We can talk more about the details of the website and our organization when we meet, but we are trying to set up meetings as soon as possible.

This app will only be used for facilitating the purchase and sale of ONE SOLE product by individual consumers â€“ much like craigslist except the transaction will take place through this app and it is only for one product.  Each listing is customized to the user by how far removed the user is from the other user who is offering or requesting the product.  Scenario 1: User 1 is looking to buy this product and User 1 sets his search for â€œimmediate friends onlyâ€ offering the product.  If User 1 is unable to find any immediate friends offering the product, User 1 may expand his search to â€œ1 friend removedâ€ to include all immediate friends of User 1â€™s immediate friends.  This should be replicated through 5 or 6 removed friend levels.  Scenario 2:  User 1 is looking to sell this product â€“ User 1 can set his posting to be available to â€œimmediate friends only,â€ â€œ1 friend removed,â€ â€œ2 friends removed,â€ etc.  It is important that the User can see who the removed friends are friends with â€“ much like a link thread on a website (For 2 friends removed:  Bob S. is friends with Jane T., who is friends with Stephen J.)  The app will need online payment processing capabilities, probably through Paypal.  The app will need the ability to take X% of the online transaction as a service fee.  Postings will need the ability to have pictures and both drop-down and free-style descriptive fields.

Were you aware that you are paying every time for your online marketing advertisement is clicked? It hurts! I know, as many of our clients have shared this frustration when I first talked to them about how to drive more quality prospects to their sites - without having to constantly pay for every click.

I thought you might like to know some of the reasons why you are not getting more organic (FREE) search engine traffic for Pearsestreet.com

1. Open directory listing is not available.

2. Your site has 124 Yahoo back links, this can be improved further.



If you can stomach more bad news about what your site needs and are curious to know what our working together would involve then I would be glad to provide you with further detailed analysis in the form of a SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) SITE REPORT - FREE OF CHARGE. I would first need to know that you are serious about using our services, as the report would involve several hours of our research.

To brief you about the company, we are a SEO Company with a worldwide customer base. A team of over 700 SEO specialists in USA and India, serving a vast portfolio of clients who have transformed their businesses by just opting for our services.Thus, we would like to talk with you about how you should be winning new business from the search engines without paying advertisers over and over again for it.

SEO is not instantaneous, it is not free but it is the only sensible internet marketing choice.Your return on investment (ROI) after 6 months of SEO will be at least 3 times that of paid advertisements and many times greater than our cost. In fact, we guarantee that in the first month of our work, you will see an improvement in ranking, link popularity and traffic or we\\\'ll work for free until you do! Our clients consistently tell us that their customers find them because they are at the top in Google. Being on the top left of Google (#1- #5 Organic positions) is the best thing you can do for your company\\\'s website traffic and online reputation.

Ironically,it\\\'s very likely that you spent your last 6 months of online marketing in dollars on SEO instead of paid advertising that you would have 3 times or greater traffic than today and not need the paid advertising at all.

Fortunately, you can still start today and begin getting that traffic in just a few weeks.We look forward to discuss our SEO plans with you.

Sounds interesting? Feel free to email us or alternatively you can provide your best time and phone number to call you.

Best Regards,
San

It is vitally important this website works this way as im going to use it to create an exisitng customer base for other ventures im planning within the uk cycling industry. My goal is to be the uks number one cycling website so coming on the first page of the google search for people looking for cycling related topics is vital. At the minute the site gets about 3000 hits per month however no one is actually joining the site. Looking at some competitors i know the target audience is there. So im putting it down to lack of content and user functions on the site as well as what i regard as an unfinished made in a bedroom look which is frustratiing when im trying to add things to the site.  Feel free to have a look at my site and give me ideas on how we can make this a more userfriendly and successful site.

I would like to create an iphone app that allows potential app developers to search the istore to see if their app idea has already been created, or if there is an idea out there currently that is similar to their idea. What I would like to create is like a patent search. For example, when you go to USPO website you can input a full description of your idea and see if your concept or idea is already in the process of being created or if it has already been developed.

I know so many people who are obsessed with coming up with the next great app, but the ideas are already developed, they just don\\\'t know because new apps come out daily. I would like for users to put in a detailed description and have that information return apps that are similar to the information they entered, or have it come back with no information which would let the user know that there is no app like has been developed.

I would eventually like to create this app for the android as well. I have a number of app ideas as well that I have talked with developers about and the downside of that is that some developers can tell you if it is possible to create the app and sometimes they can tell you if they know of an app like the one you want them to build, but they don\\\'t know every app that has been developed. This app would be useful in developing apps, as well as searching for an app that you want to use and that you would like to have on your phone.

I would like to create a coupon app, that would allow users to take pictures or scan the barcodes of newspaper insert coupons and scan them at the checkout counter at the supermarket. 

The user would scan the barcode then input some information like expiration date and location the coupon should be mailed to. The cashier should be able to print out two receipts. One for the customer and one for them to keep that contains the addresses of the manufactures the coupons have to be mailed to at the end of the month.

I know this app is complicated and I have spoken to at least two developers that all say that it can be done, I am just looking for more options and the opinions of other developers.

Here is a tool that will auto create an RSS feed of relevant content on any search term. The data is pulled from the major search engines real time and is cached for about 15 minutes then updates.

If you are good enough to parse the content server side then it will give the site SEO benefit for displaying topically relevant content in their sidebars with authoritative relevant outbound links. It technically will be duplicate content (compared with the web) but it is time sensitive great content. Even if you use the normal javascript parsing like in many sidebar widgets today, it will still benefit the visitors to the sites to view really great news in the sidebar.

If you dynamically change the search term in the RSS url call you will be able to add different content on pages of your site that need more text to prevent being duplicate content in comparison to other pages on the same site. This means the pages of your site have a higher percentage of different content then each other. This will benefit SEO but also pay per click quality score metrics. For those who know how to create auto posts based on RSS feeds have a go at it. :)

Example, you could pull the category of the page or one or more of the tags and auto replace the search term variable in the RSS url call. You should look into how this can be used because it can create an auto updating RSS feed on any topic in the world. You can also use normal search operators a lot of times (Not ALL) like site:domain.com and site:.gov and site:.edu, etc. to really laser in your results.

Just change the search term (TOPIC+HERE) on the end of this url. http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=693627c710f2f187f8957447eb33f0af&_render=rss&search_term=TOPIC+HERE','status' => '1','datestamp' => '1292302381','followup' => '0','packet' => '0','call' => '0','user_id' => '0'),

I also have a fantastic, unique idea for a social networking website. 


Purpose:
 The purpose of the site is to allow users to login and post detailed blogs explaining any personal problems or issues they may have, aiming to find like-minded users who may offer advice and support. 
 
People create their own accounts, using a username (not real name), which includes information on age, occupation and location. 
 
 
The way it works: 
Create a user account, and post as many blogs as you like. All blogs will be checked by the moderator/administrator before being published to the site. Other users are able to post comments on people\\\'s blogs, and have the ability to \\\'follow\\\' a particular user (to check up on progress etc). Any innapropriate comments will be reported and that user an be removed. 
 
Each blog includes \\\'tag words\\\', to allow them to be categorised easily. 
 
Non members are able to read blogs, but not comment/post blogs or follow members until they have signed up. Sign up will be free, using personal details (email address, age, occupation, location and username).
 
a private messaging service - only \\\'friends\\\' can private message eachother. 
 
A \\\'search\\\' facility to search for specific problems using the tag words. 
 
Log-in using username and password. 
 
Options available to registered \\\'users\\\':
 
have a \\\'my homepage\\\' which would allow them to:
 
private message \\\'friends\\\' online
write a new blog
specify which categories they are interested in
view recently added blogs in the same categories as what they are interested in 
view blogs they have previously commented on
 
 
Is it Viable:
 It would make money using targeted advertising towards the specifics categories. (for example, the \\\'gambling addiction\\\' section could feature ads for gamblers anonymous...
 
Advertising revenue will be the main source of income. 
 
 
Summary
 
This is essentially a platform which enables large amount of users (10,000 +) to post detailed blogs, find friends, offer advice on similar problems. It will be a hugely rewarding service which would allow people to anonymously relieve themselves of their problems and seek help from like minded people. As well as being a profitable website, I hope it has a positive influence on peoples lives.

I would like the network to have a fresh modern feel w/Facebook like features. In terms of book exchange I would like members to be able to post books they are willing to part with. 

There are a few concepts out there that I like, but each one is lacking something. My Back Cover will combine them all, I would like my back cover to have similar features to paperbackswap.com, bookins.com & goodreads.com 

Members should have a profile that reflects them, a section to post books they would like to exchange, a wish list of books that they would like and will be alerted if they come available, a section to rate books, create forums etc. Also I would like chat room features, forum features and video chat. 
The book exchange portion should be smooth and simple. 
1)Member posts book they would like to exchange
2)Member that wants book selects it
3)They then automatically pay the postage on the page and the sender is emailed the shipping label by us. 
4)Please reference the other companies I mentioned to understand process. I would prefer to have the person requesting the book pay for shipping rather than the one sending it though.  

The webpage should have smooth quick search features so members can find forums, chat rooms, member book reviews and books for exchange by typing simple key words.

Its along the lines of  linkedin.com but with better and more features. You create a profile about yourself and if your looking for employment you would fill out employment questions. Once you create an account you can search for people by the different business fields, type in their name or by company. For companies, there will be a little description of what it is and once you create your profile you can add yourself to that company. So you can search companies and see what theyâ€™re all about and the people working for them. Then there would be tabs like business insider, business talk, employment and international business. Business insider would cover stocks, currencies, forums on business to invest inâ€¦etc, huge business events and decisions, business news. For business talk you will be able to have a conference call with your business associates that have accepted your friend request, much like skpye. You will be able to talk while having a ppt up much like a business meeting. There will also be an instant messenger here so you can talk amongst your friends. For employment there will be jobs that companies post and people that are looking for employment. You will be able to search for jobs through the different fields. That works for both companies looking for employees and people looking for companies. International business contain news outside the North America and internationally based companies and opportunities, also including a international business blog or forum. If it can be done, I would also like to integrate an email on their so people can send emails to business associates.','status' => '0','datestamp' => '1295158521','followup' => '0','packet' => '1','call' => '0','user_id' => '0'),

I\\\'m a small start up with very solid ideas. I\\\'m also a producer. I produce and promote NEW and Exclusive content in the entertainment genre. (NO ADULT STUFF!) Anyway, I\\\'m looking for a nice site to do this with. Almost think of how a WordPress Blog can distribute and archive endless content for years. I already have a great domain name and logo done. The planning for this site goes back to 2007. It\\\'s not some passing idea. It\\\'s the real thing. My issue is, that everyone tells me they can build it and can\\\'t. And quite honestly, 10 grand is a lot for me. This is all funded by me. But on other hand, I don\\\'t need tons of features. I\\\'d like to discuss this.. At any rate, the \\\'showing off\\\' and distribution of my content is not the hard part. It\\\'s using this a a center piece to draw in members and allow them to join and mingle. So that\\\'s the social network. I\\\'m not letting them upload videos and go crazy. This is not face book or myspace. But some items are needed. Internal email and chat. Admin should be able to mass email all members or perhaps some if they can join at various levels. A site calendar/events. Basic stuff like this. The content showcase alone is something WordPress can do nicely. But again, this is more then just that. Looking forward to hearing back. I also was at Fuchsia Mac website earlier. Was impressive information. Thx again.

I have some great ideas, plus some social network features that facebook fails to offer. Here are my ideas:

For the website layout, no flash/animations or anything like that. Just something that looks good & simple. I want the default color (theme) to be yellow or green.

-Homepage Activity stream: The activity stream auto updates without refreshing & will be in a text box, which  is square looking but with rounded edges/corners. This way, users want have to keep scrolling down the whole page and clicked to see older activity, they just have to scroll down the box. 

Website Store (WebStore): Just a place where users can buy site themes with real money. 

-Custom Website Themes: Just different colors and designs that users can choose to buy from the website store.

- Video Chat: Something like a skype - like webcam chat built into the website.

-Group Chat:  Instant messaging so that multiple people can talk in the same chat thing.

- Unlike Facebook, \\\'notifications\\\' will be shortened to \\\'notices\\\'.

-A popchat thing on the bottom of the page like facebook.

- Unlimited Friends: No limit on how many friends a user can have.

- A feature where you can set how many people you want friend requesting at a time. (Example: You can set to recieve only 50 request at a time. Any other who trys to friend request you will not be able to.)

-A TV Guide Feature. A user can like pick their favorite channels/shows & create their own personal tv guide. They can set 10 min. or 5 min. show reminder before the show starts so they won\\\'t forget. It will pop up any any page they are on, notifying them.

-Choose not to allow friend requests at all. Only you can send them.

-Like and Dislike button with statuses.

-\\\'Block this user\\\' will be replaced to \\\'Ban this user\\\'.

-Popchat logs. Saves popchat messages with each friend and only deletes it when you do it manually. So it shows all popchat history between you and a friend on a seperate page, until you delete it. Or you can choose to not save any messages in the user settings section.

-Smileys/little icons/emoticons in inbox messages & status updates, not just on popchat.

-All basic features like facebook (friend requests, events, event invites, pages, page invites, etc.)','status' => '4','datestamp' => '1295402988','followup' => '0','packet' => '1','call' => '0','user_id' => '0'),

Of course I would be very interested in your marketing methods and the cost.

I would also appreciate the time for development and how it is done via the internet communications with myself.

Regarding the coding, who will have rights / ownership of the coding?

I am looking at a kickoff date of approximately May, 2011.  A detailed cost projection and payments for my Business Plan would be very helpful as well.

The memory page will initially pull in data from FB to populate its fields and then will be editable by a designated administrator.  The most important field of the memory page will be made up of biographical details of members.  The memory page will have a field to upload a photo and the ability to upload photos not unlike FB.  FB members and site members will be able to comment on the memory page\\\'s walls and on uploaded photos.  The memory page will also be able to send messages to FB members and others who have joined the memory page.  

One of the fields of the memory page will be a geographic coordinate linked to Google Maps.  It would also be of eventual interest for site visitors to be able to send cash gifts (perhaps via Paypal) to the designated family contact (or Admin) of members\\\' memory pages. 

The database portion of the project is at the center of this project and there should be a way for site administrator to quickly upload and/or add new memory pages to the database.   

The look of the site would be very minimalist, perhaps gray and white tones such as Wikipedia and very simple in its presentation as not to distract from the content of members\\\' memory pages.','status' => '2','datestamp' => '1295550526','followup' => '0','packet' => '1','call' => '0','user_id' => '0'),

My name is Romena Ibrahim and I am seeking a quote for The Bay Citizen; an online newspaper exclusive to the Bay Area.  I am wondering if I can seek a quote from your organization in relation to Facebook tabs/applications.

In May, we are having our second annual launch party. To celebrate we are running a competition called â€œThe Bay Citizen of the Yearâ€. This consists of residents from the Bay Area submitting a video or photo about the business they conduct and how it impacts the bay community. The goal is to increase Facebook likes and comments on our page.  

We are looking for two eye-grabbing tabâ€™s or applications which allows submissions to be posted easily and accessibly to our fan page. 

The first tab will be the one that allows the video/photo submission then in April we will need a second tab that will allow people to vote for the winner. We only want viewers to vote once, so it must be exclusive. However we also want voters to be able to post comments underneath the video/photo. We also need a logo/branding.

Can you give me an idea on a sense of timing? If we need to have the video submission tab up and running on March 15, what is your lead time?

Can you also send me an example of a video or photo submission contest that you have designed previously?

Please feel free to contact myself on 415 860 7516

Our goal and intent is to build collaborative relationships with our clients so our costs are reasonable and we can work with you to accommodate your budget. 

Some of our specialties include:

It is my personal and professional goal to welcome new clients into our â€œfamily,â€ as well as provide stellar customer service to new and existing customers.  Iâ€™m willing to bet that you can relate, and that we are striving for the same thing.  That said I would love an opportunity to discuss how we can help each other achieve our goals.

 My name is Rick Solis and Im interested in attaining information on the possibility of having a website built. the site will be  a social networking based site for the music industry. There is already a site in existance that is close to what Im looking to do, that site being: www.rocbattle.com

The basic concept of the site is pretty close what Im looking to do. Id like a site in which artists and producers can network, narket themselves through user based voting competitions and various other site tools as well as sell their produced tracks and finished music through the site. Of course I have a lot of details that Im not going to discuss within this email. But with the basic information Ive given, Id like to get at least a rough, ball park figure of what something like the site I linked you too would cost. Im ok with using an existing template and just adding to it as I feel doing so would definitely keep pricing on the conservative side. Im just really looking to get an idea of what something like that would cost to build.

Please get back to me ASAP.

We will be hosting them on our site so that if we update an image after the release of the app, it will automatically get updated without the need for an update of the app.  

I\\\'m hoping you can provide us with a quote once you\\\'ve had a chance to look at the iPhone app.  I\\\'m going to be traveling the next week or two so e-mail will be the best way to reach me.  

Thanks.

We have some strong leads on funding and want to put a proposal together by the end of the week.

Here\\\'s a few thoughts about what the website could be...

It\\\'s similar to facebook: Profile with - Mail, Chat, Photo\\\'s, Video\\\'s, Info, Friends, Wall Posts.

It\\\'s different to facebook: Experiential learning, Recognition of Accomplishments and Awards, Mentorship, Webinars.

1) Experiential Learning - By creating a profile on the site, the person can enter a skills program, in which they would have to complete a certain number of hours or credits in the four areas a) Volunteer work, b) Education, c) Mentorship, d) Seminar, conference, or webinars.

The initial level could be CESR Skills Program (Corporate Environmental Social Responsibility) and then after the person has completed that first program, they can move on to more specialised skills programs ie international, environmental, microcredit ect.

Progress and designations achieved would be shown on the persons profile.

2) Members could be nominated by others for certain types of awards created by the site, which would also show on their profile. These awards could also apply to businesses or organizations that create a profile.

3) Members could search for other members to get into mentorship opportunities. Website could then be a venue to interact with the mentor. Members could be matched with mentors using a similar way that eHarmony matches with dating ect...

4) Webinar - free online conference or lecture for the members on the site.

Anyways... Those are just a few quick thoughts, not sure if that will make sense to you right now, but we can talk more about it.

Thank you,

Michael

An android app that will allow multiple users to pair to a pc/mac as a bluetooth keyboard to send specific text strings on the click of a button.

eg:
The start screen has an input box drop box to allow the user to input a user ID1 to 999.
After this, this goes to screen two.
Screen 2 this will include some text and a button that goes to screen 3.
Screen 3 is the main screen.
On screen 3 are four large coloured (RED/YELLOW/GREEN/BLUE, similar to a PS3 Buzz Buzzer buttons....labelled A,B,C and D.
On the press of one of the buttons, the software sends the User ID plus the button label letter as a keystroke text string, via bluetooth to the connected device.
After one press of any button, it needs to go to screen 4.
Screen 4 has some text saying ie: THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER and a button labeled GO TO NEXT QUESTION...this button then loops back to screen three.

From the creatorsâ€¦
Have you ever seen someone and felt that you had an immediate connections, but just didnâ€™t know what to say?  Was the timing too awkward to go up to them and introduce yourself?  Did you find it extremely difficult to come up with something to say and decide to hold your tongue to avoid the embarrassment?  Are you kicking yourself for letting him or her get away?  Weâ€™ve been there too!
Thatâ€™s exactly why hibye.ws was created.  We take the awkwardness of out meeting people.  Our site offers you a way to connect with that person without having to say anything at all.  Remember, sometimes the best pickup line may be no pickup line at all!

How it worksâ€¦
If you see someone and feel the spark, but donâ€™t get the opportunity to connect simple log into your free account, type in the address (5 mile radius) and approximate time that you saw this person (within an hour), and see if that person felt the same spark.  If they did you will see a picture of that person and they will see yours.  If further communication is desired you will need to log into your account and send them a â€œconnection request.â€  That person can either accept or deny the request.  If they accept you will be gain access to the other memberâ€™s full profile containing personal information, pictures, likes and dislikes, and much more.
If the connection is still there either of the members can send a personalized â€œdate requestâ€ to the other member.  That member can then accept or deny the date request.
The rest is up to you!

I look forward to working with you.

I am extremely stressed and bootstrapping my company right now. Please view our site though at www.BarChefs.com. I am making some incredible products. Basically, I am an enginner gone mad lol. S

I make these glowing bars, tables, and stuff like that.

About a month ago, I was able to structure a deal with the actual company Wildfire. I made them an extremely expensive glowing widlfire branded table and they gave me a $2,000 promotion package. Hopefully your familiar with Wildfire apps.

I am looking for someone to run my contest. Not only do I need someone who can design the white lable coding, but I need someone who can integrate it with facebook, youtube, etc.. and offer any other ideas.

I don\'t have hardly any money so spend. Im actually in over my head. The good thing is that I took a risk and my companies products are selling LIKE HOT CAKES. However, I had to buy reallly expensive machines to make them possible.

I need someone experienced to please HELP ME. Will you guys do a similar arrangement that I made with Wildfire? I will custom design you some stuff to match your company logo? or for your house? or something great? Most of our custom designs sell in the thousands. It\'s easier for me to offer you this as thousands of dollars of work is possible where as thousands of dollars is non-existent lol. I hope that makes sense. 

If you think you can help me I would love some help. I need help. I have too much that I have to handle all alone and am so worried about funds right now. Thanks for your consideration.

I am developing a new professional/social networking website and . It is, in essence, a cross between the functionalities of a dating website and something like Couchsurfing (where you can recommend and rate users based on your experience with them). At this point, we are just looking for some rough estimates as we are in the beginning stages of development. The actual creation of the site won\\\'t happen until probably around August or September. 

The site would feature:

-signup/ login (it\\\'s free so payment tools aren\\\'t necessary--though we would like to have a donate button---though it can link directly to paypal)
-customer created profiles (with a biography, photo gallery, info about them and what they are looking for)
-in-system mailbox/mail system so users can securely contact each other
-tools for recommending people after they\\\'ve worked with them (ala couchsurfing\\\'s Vouched system--- http://www.couchsurfing.org/vouch.html)
-indepth search functions that can search by job, skill, location and rating
-Main page with blog, featured users and basic search engine
--Basic About and Contact pages

In the future (after the site is up and running)----we would add the following capabilities, so they should be kept in mind while building the site:
-Eventually,  we\\\'d like the capability to switch to other languages (ala couchsurfing)
-Compatible with an iphone/blackberry app
-Ad space (banner and on the sides)

I need a quote by the middle of this week. If possible, can you provide quotes with and without graphics and also estimates on how long a site like this would take to build. Please let me know what other information I can provide for you. Thanks in advance!!

Sincerely,
Jody

Celebs are constantly doing it on twitter for eg Alan Sugar and Piers Morgan.

The sit is MusicConnext.com (have not bougt domain name).  The idea is a combination of networking (or connexting as we call it) and following, this site is directed more towards the music industry.  There are three parts to the business idea.  There will be a page for Artist, Fans, and Producers.  
    Artists can set up a profile (bio, genre, etc.) with information about themselves.  IT will also allow them to upload there music/music videos for fans and producers.  Fans are also able to log in and set up there own profile (minimum information).  They then can \\"Rock and Roll\\" with there favorite band (similar to following) and be up to speed on there next concert, CD releasal, etc.  The Producers are then able to set up a more private profile/log-in if they like.  This will allow them to have access to artists personal information so they can contact them in regards to meeting with one another.  
   In a way this to able to connext all three groups together.  Artists are able to network themselves with fans and try to make it big with Producers, Fans can \\"Rock and Roll\\" with there favorite artist or group (a way to connext with there Idol), and Prodcuers can connext with artist to find the next big Star.
   Where Social Networking is headed there is a lot of upside to an idea like this.  A friend of mine and myself have been trying to set up a sit on our own but have come to find out is a little more challenging and would need professional help. Any help is much appreciated and look forward to hearing from you all.

2. As we have searched about social networks, they are always developing and increasing the number of users, so, how is your servicing and supporting in the future?
3. Shall your software run on your servers as host or we can run it on the other hosts?
4. At first we think about 10k as capital, so can we have timeline in order to the expenses and minimum investment?
5. How long does it take from starting point of the project until the first (alpha or beta) release?

The book is going to be titled The Distance:  An Average Joe\'s Path to the Iron-Distance Triathlon.  (Because I couldn\'t get the copyright to say the word "Ironman" in my book title).

The niche for my book is that I am an Average Joe.  I\'ve got a job, kids, wife,  and love handles.  I make eggs for the kids, take the dog out, and spend all day at work.  BUT...I was able to balance all of that with training for the world\'s most ultra-endurance triathlon.  So the market for my book is the common man, the Average Joe like myself who maybe has done a small triathlon before (or not), and has in the back of their mind toyed with the notion of "I wonder if I could do an Ironman?"  My book motivates, inspires and it also guides others to do as I have done - cross the Ironman finish line!

I\'m very excited about the potential that I really think my book has at becoming a bit of an underdog (cult following even) book.  I don\'t have a big budget obviously, but I want to exploit the full potential of social media.  I will be using the internet almost exclusively for marketing my book.  I don\'t have a traditional publisher (I\'m using Liberty University Press), and I don\'t want to use traditional means of marketing either (who the heck listens to talk radio shows about books anyway?).

Since I\'ve got 4 months until publication I have not started or launched anything online yet.  I think it\'s too far out to maintain the momentum.  I have gone ahead and purchased an URL.  But I have not launched the site yet.  It\'s going to be www.TheAverageIronman.com

And I do have a Twitter account (very very new) @AverageIronman

Please let me know what your thoughts are on marketing my book and what you\'re fees are (be gentle, it\'s my first time).  

I look forward to hearing from you,

I am looking for both a designer and a developer to build a website that is dedicated to networking and video sharing. In it\\\'s first iteration it will be a scaled down hybrid of facebook and youtube for an existing niche community that will be transplanted to the site.  

I want people to be able to create a profile, create networks of friends, message friends, see realtime community activity in a news feed, upload/download/purchase music, upload video, and rate videos.

Designer:
I would like to work with a designer who can work with me to create a clean, futuristic, innovative design. I have completed mock-ups and a wire frame from which the designer will work, however, I require a designer who has the artistic ability and business acumen to interpret and improve the current design.

Developer:
I have a technical advisor whom I trust who will be periodically overseeing the project. I require a developer who can enact the vision that I\\\'ve created with this advisor and is comfortable working on a team.

The developer must:
Understand how to create a scalable site that can be easily picked up by another developer, expanded, and improved upon.
Program in either python or ruby
Be an expert at SEO
Be capable of delivering a social network  a la Facebook (complete with profiles, \\"friend\\" capabilities, messaging, \\"newsfeed\\" information, etc.)
Know how to handle upload/download of music
Be able to create video sharing infrastructure a la YouTube

What I am doing here is trying to get an idea on the costs of these projects for a wide range of consumers. We would want to partner with your company and bring you work.  My budget is completely flexible.


I would actually like to hire someone to develop an iPhone, Android, Windows OS app that I can get in each
marketplace (Apple store, Android. Etc). I would like estimate pricing on the following apps. I would also
like as much information as possible regarding the time it takes for an app to be completed, the cost, the
development style your team uses (SCRUM, etc), and what information is needed from me at the outset. Many of
these applications are created, but I would like to see the pricing so I can relate my similar projects to
them. 
Type I: Develop an application that can perform calculations. 
Type II: Develop a game similar to Angry Birds 
Type III: Develop a news application similar to the New York Times App. (Assume we have a news publication
site and the articles will be pulled from there) 
Type IV: Develop an app that allows users to subscribe to various blogs and receive feed updates within the
app. 

Type V: Develop an application that uses Augmented Reality to find the closest Starbucks 
Type VI: Develop an application that allows for Video Chat from one phone to another, or from one phone to a
computer 
Type VII: Develop and application that allows a user to remotely log in to a pc from their phone and control
the mouse and keyboard with their phone. If possible, provide an additional scope on implementing voice
activated computing via this app. 

I look forward to the assessments on each of these projects. I can let you know that we will be moving
forward on many of these soon, so finding a quality provider who can provide proven results is exactly what we
need.

Mission
â€œHall of Fadedâ€ is an interactive entertainment database for college-aged people who are looking to hear the latest faded news and gossip. It is a website where these people can spend their time when they are not studying or getting â€œfaded,â€ where pictures, videos, and outlandish behavior will be accepted and protected. Through the site and medley of graphic content, â€œHall of Fadedâ€ will be a vessel to inform the youth on the latest happenings and encourage interaction among themselves online. Our mission is to promote the concept of â€œgetting fadedâ€ among friends while still maintain a sense of privacy to prevent getting â€œin trouble.â€ 
Operation Description
Faded is a term used when a person is under the influence. For example, â€œShit, I canâ€™t even walk straight Iâ€™m so damn faded.â€ This website will be for entertainment purposes, such as that as a www.textsfromlastnight.com  or www.fmylife.com  but will have a social networking aspect tied into it. 
This site will use content such as pictures, videos, and messages (i.e. snapshots of faded texts) that are uploaded onto the site by its users. One part of the website (main) will consist of Walls (albums) within the Hall of Faded, while the other part of the site will have the content directly uploaded onto the userâ€™s profiles.
The site will consist of two major parts: the Hall of Faded â€œTop Wallsâ€ (public) and the user profile (very private).
Top Walls: This is the Home Page of the website. Here, the public can browse through funny and edgy pictures of people under the influence. The content will be voted upon by users and the top voted will have a chance to take a spot on the Hall of Faded website. Also, this is where the different Walls will be. The website will be composed of Walls within the Hall of Faded. Each Wall will have a theme, for example, Top Hook Up Wall, where users submit â€œfadedâ€ pictures of people kissing. The website will be broken down by Cities and/or Colleges, or it can be nationwide. These Walls will have the pictures of the highest rated/creative pictures or videos and will be updated every week. Also, the Walls could have themes depending on the time of year, for example, Mardi Gras theme where users attempt to send in the best â€œfadedâ€ pictures to the site. We might pre-plan this event asking for specific things, for instance, the best picture one can take involving alcohol, Mardi Gras beads, and a mask.The highest rated pictures are then rewarded by being featured on the siteâ€™s Wall of Mardi Gras and first place may receive a prize (t-shirt, shot glasses, caps, lighters, trophies, etc)

User Profile: The website will have a homepage where the user will be prompted to create an account or login. Once they create an account or logged in, the user will be directed to their personal page. The page will be â€œFacebook Styleâ€ intertwined with the Hall of Faded. The layout should be like that of the Hall of Faded but almost like a private mini-network between friends, instead of the whole website, where users can send and receive messages, add friends, add their own personal Walls (albums) etc. Also, the profiles will be named after the userâ€™s name for instance, Biancaâ€™s Hall of Faded, and within my Hall, I will be able to create Walls (albums) where I can upload my pictures/videos. â€œWall of Mexicoâ€ may be an album I chose to create where I upload faded pictures from a recent trip to Mexico. The way users become friends is by giving out their pin numbers, this way, no one is able to search their names, location, etc, making sure that parents, employers, etc. do not search their names. Also, users can tag other friends of thereâ€™s but the tag must be approved by the other user.
This site will use content such as pictures, videos, messages, that are uploaded onto the site by the siteâ€™s users. One part of the website (main) willconsist of Top Rated Walls (pictures/albums) within the Hall of Faded, while the other part of the site will be a social networking tool.','status' => '2','datestamp' => '1299733682','followup' => '0','packet' => '1','call' => '0','user_id' => '30'),

I am contacting you about possibly developing a social networking site. I contacted megastarmedia.com and they gave me your email address. 
 
My business partners and I are currently reviewing qualifications from developers.  
 
We would like to arrange a time to speak to you via Skype so we can explain our project in more detail. One interactive tool of our social networking page is a news feed that is displayed horizontally. An example of this news feed is the scoreboard from NBA.com:  http://www.nba.com/ (notice the various box scores are displayed horizontally and the user can view more box scores by clicking an arrow). 
 
Our goal is to launch our social networking website by August 1, 2011. We would like to have it nearly done by July 1st in order for the developer to have time to address our concerns/requests for modifications. 
 
We hope we can arrange a time to talk to you via Skype.  Please let us know when you are free.

1.	According to the packagesâ€™ prices, we would like to see at least two sample for each option (price option), or if the social networks have been customized by your clients, so please let us to have samples between each price range (as an illustration, X.com and Y.com are in the range of USD 50000 to USD 55000).
2.	In the future, how would be the customerâ€™s authority to customize the layout and software features according to Pearse Street software copyright, terms and conditions (or can we have a copy of terms and conditions of use)?
3.	How are we secured to receive Pearse Streetâ€™s services and supports in overseas (particularly in Malaysia)?
4.	Is it possible to have live internet conferencing via Skype or any similar solution?

The site will function similarly to airbnb.com, which provides a marketplace for informal travel lodging. Rather than lodging, though, Qualiact.com will give local individual and organizations in tourism destinations who are not part of the full-time travel industry, but nonetheless can offer interesting and authentic experiences, a place to market these experiences. The core outreach will specifically target NGOs and community groups who have expressed an interest in providing tourism experiences but are not ready to become full tourism operators (groups I am in touch with in my current work in the NGO sector). The website would therefore function as marketplace with a social network feel, where people and organizations in tourism locales put up profiles for each experience they can offer, and tourists can book these experiences through the site and leave reviews and comments.

I am currently in the process of writing a business plan to present to investors, and would therefore like a general quote from Pearse Street as to the cost of contracting the design and development aspects of the site.

My team and I are looking for a quote as to the costs of developing a new e-reader platform for our publishing company. We would like the basic UI and account system to work similar to Kobo\\\'s app, with an included bookstore and web-based user accounts that allow users to cache each book on any device running the app under the same account; we need the reader interface to be basically a web browser that scales to the size of the screen, flows content and flips pages rather than scrolling in any direction, allowing us to program all of our books individually using CSS, XML and other common webpage development formats and practices. It must be able to either run online, reading the books from our servers, or be cached on the devices. We also require the reader allow us to include embedded media such as small videos, sounds, songs, maps, images, etc. within the pages.
We would need the app set up for iOS (both iPhone and iPad) and Android platforms, as well as the web-based account system.

I would like to have a quote for a website. It is a social network for musicians that would have a mix of different features. In general, the site needs to be very simple and practical. 


The main basic features needed for the site are:


- Sign up/login/personal page
- A simple forum with general sections.
- A good storage for the pictures, videos and sounds.
- A simple audio player and video player.
- E-mail account.
- Main social medias links for each picture/video/audio uploaded by the user.
- Make the site appear on google search engines.

About the features, I would like to know if it would be possible to implement this
in the site (http://www.guitarbattle.com.br/). It\\\'s a guitar battle where you can vote for the better song and comment on it that includes a ranking system for those with most victories.

Also, I would like to have a gear review section (provided by the users) like the ones you find when you go to a site like harmonycentral.com . The problem is that there is a great number of equipment and creating a page for each would take a very long time. Is it possible to automatize it? Automatically create pages with only the basic info of the equipment? Including also a YouTube link with the most relevant videos related to the equipment. 

Finally, how long it takes to design a social network?


Thank you!

My name is Dylan Castillo.  I would like an estimate to have a crowd funding site created.  What is crowd funding? Crowd funding is the collective cooperation by people who network and pool their money and other resources together, usually via  a website, to support and fund efforts initiated by other people or organizations. This is a site where people can go to upload projects that they are trying to raise funds for and their peers and philanthropist can donate money to the project or cause they desire.  I would like you to look at the sites www.kickstarter.com and www.rockethub.com. bc this is what i am basically looking for and it will give you a good idea.  Please look at these sites and tell me what you think,  in terms of complexity and what you can do for me. The major component that I feel is important is the ability for creatives ( people looking to raise funds) to be able to upload user generated content \\"UGC\\" info and a video presentation.  The rest of the site is very straight forward. It is easiest if you reply via email.

So sit down, relax, grab yourself a cup of coffee and a biscuit or two as you in for a long ride! :)

I want to create a social network similar to lockerz.com - Gaining most of their features and combining them together with one or two other different sites that have different features.

The main idea is an interactive social networking site where user\\\'s will be able to gain Points for being active. With these points, they can redeem for prizes such as Games, and other electronic stuff.

The main theme to the site is a site that reports things that are trending. So for example news that people are talking about i.e Osama Bin Ladin\\\'s killing. An article on this will be posted and there will be a poll for every article written with poll questions for user\\\'s to answer like if they liked this article ect. User\\\'s will get points for submitting their choices on articles. - Every time i make a poll with custom questions and answer\\\'s i choose for user\\\'s to answer to - It should have  a colorful boarder around the polls.

The site should have a static homepage that explains what the site is about. Similar to facebook and lockerz.com when not logged in. - There should be a catchy, colourful, retro looking homepage similar to lockerz.com - On this static homepage - User\\\'s will be able to Login snd register. - Facebook connect should also appear on the homepage for user\\\'s to sign up using facebook if they wish.

The site should be locked off none logged in user\\\'s. - A similar process should be in place lockerz.com - Where user\\\'s can invite other people join the site. Through an invitation system on the site. User\\\'s will be able to use their friend\\\'s email address\\\'s to send out invitations and facebook too.

The site should be SEO optimised for browser\\\'s and search engines. I would like the site work on all common browser\\\'s as well as work on iphones / Android phones ect.

Site should be clean coded,

The features for the site:

Article/Polls - I will be able to write articles where user\\\'s can read these articles and answer a poll which i make on the articles written - User\\\'s will be able to answer these polls and earn points for doing so.

Image upload section on site - Combine features of popular image upload sites into one. - User\\\'s will earn points into their accounts for uploading images.

Video section - Similar to lockerz.com/play - User\\\'s will be able to watch videos from youtube - And they will earn points into thier accounts for watching videos. There will be a comment box under each video where user\\\'s can make comments on the video they have watched. 

Games section - Using a popular gaming script - Mochimedia - Build a user interactive game section where user\\\'s will be able to earn points for playing games. The gaming section should have a similar look/interface as - http://www.miniclip.com/games/en/ http://www.addictinggames.com/  - There will be a comment box under each game where user\\\'s can make comments on the game they have played.

Reedem section - Similar to ptzplace.lockerz.com - This will be the place where member\\\'s can redeem their points for games/electronics.- So like a ecomerence kind of section. 

User settings - Similar to lockerz.com - User\\\'s can change their password and address information / However they cannot change their email address - They should contact support for this.

User\\\'s will have their own wall, similar to facebook\\\'s wall where they can do the exact stuff that facebook has supported in their wall feature system. 

User\\\'s will be able to create groups and pages, invite friends/member\\\'s of the site to these groups and pages. - Groups and pages should function/look work like facebooks.

User\\\'s should also have a notification system like facebook. Friend requests/ friend emails and messages from me. Where i can send on site messages to users.

User Statistics - How many points earned ect / Refferals / order status  - Look at swagbucks and lockerz.com for an example of this.

A Promotional section - User\\\'s will be able to promote the site - user\\\'s will get points for doing so - Linking with the referral section example:
http://www.swagbucks.com/p/promote-banners   - Custom made banners like swagbucks - Please look at the above link for an idea.

Hallway section - A section on site where i can make public announcements.

Advertisement placements control is key - I should be able to insert codes from like adsense in the admin panel where ads will pop up around the site.

Survey\\\'s section - Similar to what lockerz.com/Swagbucks.com/

Dalies section - Similar to lockerz.com - User\\\'s will be able to answer daily questions which i make and get points for answering them.

Trade in section - User\\\'s will be able to trade in items such as games/phones and other electrical where they can get points for doing so. I will be able to list items that we are accepting for trade, and how many points user\\\'s will get for the item that are going to trade in. If an item that is not listed for trade in - They can contact us. LOOK AT http://www.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-tradein for an example.

Admin backend panel.

Control user\\\'s - Point\\\'s levels / Ban user\\\'s / Disable user\\\'s accounts / Ip address\\\'s of signed up user\\\'s

Control comments made - Games/Article section / Video section

Redeem section - Control prizes - Add prizes / Photo of prizes / Description of prizes / Value of prizes

Contol how much points user\\\'s will get from uploading photo\\\'s

Control content on the site - Categories / Make Articles to go into specific categories / create polls ect.

Advertisement placements - Can add ad codes in the backend where ads will show up around the site.

Google analytics code - Place the analytics code where i can track traffic sources

Put the site on Maintenance - I can bring the site down for maintenance - When i do this a \\\'We are down for maintenance should appear up\\\' with a colourful catchy cool picture. - I should still be able to control the site/login ect - And be able to put the site back up after maintenance is finish. - So i should be able to turn maintenance on and off.

- Hallway section - Here i will be able to write things for user\\\'s to see = Announcements ect.

- Play section - Here i will be able to add new videos for user\\\'s to watch from youtube, I will be able to insert videos and place them in the right video category section. I will be able to control how much points user\\\'s will get from the videos.

Games section - I will be able to control how much points user\\\'s get from games.

There will be more back-end features and maybe so more front end features.

Please let me know honestly if there\\\'s something you can can\\\'t do. It\\\'s important this as i am very fussy with things. Please give me an estimated timeframe of site completion.and price.

The site modern 2.0 looking, fresh clean looking side is important to me.

Also please say how the site will be built/ = HTML 5, Aspx ect.

Dear Android App Developer,

I am interested in hiring a developer to make an application for the Android platform for me.  I was wondering what kind of a quote you could give me on this?

I am looking for an app that when loaded up has several different categories (that I can edit), and when I click on a category it will give me a list of terms inside of it.  Then I can scroll through and/or search within this specific category.

Once I click on a term, it will then show a gallery of thumbnails that I can click on.  The thumbnails would either correspond to: PDF\\\'s, JPEG\\\'s, MP3\\\'s, or MP4\\\'s (videos).  The user can then browse through the gallery and basically browse through all of the different terms.

Another feature that I would like are in-app purchases so that when the user downloads the app they start off with like only 10 terms and can access a mini-store on the phone and buy more terms (which includes PDF\\\'s, JPEG\\\'s, MP3\\\'s, and MP4\\\'s).

The final feature that I would also like is to have all of the MP3\\\'s and MP4\\\'s to be streaming from my website.  This would require a control panel on my website for users to be able to register and purchase on there as well.  Also, I would need a control panel to be able to add new terms and their content as well as control pricing for each of them.  Whenever a user purchases something on the website then they can access it in the app and vice versa as well (this would make it so that the user would only need to buy the information once).

A few security measures that would be required are to limit the amount of devices that users can register with the app.  The reason for this is because I do not want a whole room of people sharing one account just to not have to buy the content.

I would greatly appreciate a quote.

Thanks in advance!

I would like to have a similar survey with real time reporting. Would also consider a video. This south shore company has a nice interactive web site. If we could \\"model\\" the new one after this that would be a good start. http://www.davismechanical.net/index.php
I like the questionnaires for different tasks. Also we are full service plumbing so this needs to be included. Please contact me asap at the number above. My site is hosted through Microsoft if that matters?

Best,

We are a UK based firm seeking a drupal development team. We would appreciate your taking the time to read our requirements. 
 
An introduction... We run the UK\\\'s largest online community website for property investors www.property-system.com. We run a busy forum of 5k+ members, host thousands of valuable downloadable files/media and have lots of social activity going on via facebook, youtube etc. Our current site is composed mainly of legacy systems that we have decided need replacing with a single scalable system that gives our users a much better experience. We would also like to expand the social element of our site to allow our users to better participate within the community and form collaborations with each other. 

CURRENT SET UP: 

- VbAdvanced content management portal system
- Vbulletin discussion forum
- vivvo articles system
- wordpress podcast system
- Membership restricted file/media downloads managed by \\\'links and downloads\\\' plug in through vbulletin
- Shopping cart provided by 1shoppingcart.com. Payments processed by worldpay
- Memberships managed by amember which links vbulletin with the 1shoppingcart.com

In other words several legacy systems in place currently which are not giving us what we want and hard to link them up properly. 

REQUIRED SET UP: 

- Single CMS powering forum, blogs (for all members to contribute), articles (for all members to contribute), podcast (for all members to contribute), store and manage member subscriptions for various levels of membership. 

CURRENT PROBLEMS: 

Members and guests have trouble finding relevant content. We have lots of great content but itâ€™s spread across the site and difficult to find. Also there is no single global search function that allows user to search across all our content (forum, articles, downloads etc). 

We are doing a lot socially (facebook mainly) and running lots of offline events that produce content, images, video etc that we want to utilise properly online so that our offline members can engage online as well as they do offline and continue their conversations from offline events in the online environment. 

SEO: 

We want to utilise the 200,000+ forum posts that we have built up on our site since 2006. We have more user generated content created daily - want to increase this substantially. Also do the usual on page SEO stuff which we havenâ€™t done properly on the current site. 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: 

- Create a full blogging platform for our community members. Each member automatically has their own blog within our current system but itâ€™s not flexible and we need much better integration with the rest of the content that user has posted elsewhere on the site as well as the usual social functions, i.e. facebook friends script showing who each blogger knows on facebook. 

- Articles platform that allows members to upload their own articles. We have an articles platform currently but itâ€™s not tied into anything else and rarely used. 

- Podcast platform that allows registered members to access certain podcasts based on their role/usergroup. Non registered guests can listen to a short sample only. Currently hosted in wordpress and outside the current site. 

- File/Media upload/download platform that allows members to access files/media (software, documents, audio, video etc) based on their role/usergroup. We have a links and downloads plug in within vbulletin that allows us to offer this already http://www.property-system.com/auction/vbulletin/local_links.php but it doesnâ€™t link in with the rest of the site nor have any social features, for example guests cannot access samples of restricted content, it lacks a commenting engine, no ability to display related content from forum, other related downloads, podcasts, articles etc via tagging and semantics. We are using different systems for these various features so we havenâ€™t been able to implement this without doing some custom scripting. We also require the usual statistics (views/likes etc) that 

- Current shopping cart is hosted separately through 1shopppingcart.com. Would prefer ubercart solution or similar to bring everything together so that cart knows role of logged in user and for example member purchases can automatically include member discounts - something we cannot do currently.  

- Our current forum is hosted in vbulletin and has over 200k posts which forms much of our SEO friendly content. We are aware that drupal doesnâ€™t link with vb very well and although solutions exist none provide proper integration as far as we can tell... Would prefer to keep in vbulletin but aware that this causes bridging problems where a script like vbdrupal or similar is needed to make the two talk to each other properly. The other problem concerns log ins since members must have one global log in for the site and instead they will end up with two - one for the forum and one for the drupal CMS. We have seen drupal forums and they do not offer the same functionality as vb which is dedicated forum software but if you know how to create a drupal forum that performs most of the functions of something like vb then happy to talk about a drupal solution. A drupal solution would have the added advantage of integrating properly with the rest of the site. Currently access to the forum is only available to paid members. Goijng to create a free membership level that allows free members to post on forum and interact with other members but cannot access any of the restricted content. This keeps the forum buzzing and keeps the user generated content flowing. 

- Ability to log in with Facebook, e.g. http://wpmu.org/login-with-facebook-on-any-wordpress-wpmu-or-buddypress-site-using-wp-fb-autoconnect/ 

- Events section integrated with the rest of the site... We currently have a separate website for events at www.property-networking.com. Have some simple functionality here to tie the two together for example on a users profile page list which events they have been to recently on when a ticket is purchased by a member, add the members name to an â€˜attendingâ€™ list so that people can see who will be going to an event etc 

- Not looking for overly complex custom features as we find they tend to break during routine updates and cause problems. More interested in a stable functional site. 

GOALS: 

1. To revamp our current popular site to create the best online community for people who want to be successful property investors. This involves having the many of the top investors in the country subscribed to the site and adding content regularly, allowing guests to see that we have hundreds of important documents and content available for them to easily download and provide a place where anybody can see what is new and interesting in the world of property. 

2. Generate new membership registrations to build our subscriber base to 2,000 silver level members. Naturally a percentage will sign up to Gold and Platinum memberships which is easier to do once silver members can more clearly understand the value they get from higher level membership which they donâ€™t see so much right now because current site is confusing to navigate. Silver level and above subscribers get a number of benefits - premium content, no download limits, restricted areas of the forum to chat, discounts to various products and services etc. 

3. Over time we will add content from all the main contributors in the industry, fill up the shop with the best worldwide property investment products, and continue to run our offline events which produce much of our new content. By allowing guests and members to follow their favourite members, for example clicking on â€œmore from this authorâ€ when viewing an article would list all other content - forum, podcast, video etc - posted by that expert elsewhere on the site. This creates stars out of our popular members so that they want to add lots of fresh new content to the community on a regular basis to increase their number of followers. 


TIME FRAME: 3 months. 

BUDGET: TBC once we have discussed the project in detail with you and we are confident of your capabilities to deliver the project. 
 
Please feel free to contact me if I can help you in any way.

Kind regards

1.1 General
I am searching for specialists in programming a website with functions similar to social communities, however less functions and options.

The concept of the website is absolutely new within germany and assumedly worldwide. The market analysis has shown a demand of the possibilities offered by the website.

The website shall start in a basic version and shall expand with more features and plugins in further steps.

However the community shall be programmed in a way that all administrative work can be done by myself. That means all administrative work of the users and changing of advertisers on different pages of the website.

That is the reason I am looking for a long term partnership with professionals in programming and webdesign. 

The concept for the website with all templates already exists and can be delivered when a NDA is signed and send back to me (electronically scanned). However it has to be considered that the concept is created for a completely new program to be developed. However I would prefer the concept to be adapted to an already existing standard software as the budget available is limited. For this reason changes of this concept are possible as far as the main basic function is assured.

The quote shall contain costs for:
â€¢	Design the templates
â€¢	developing the software
â€¢	implementation on server
â€¢	short documentation
â€¢	training by telephone


Proposal for schedule:
1.	First information is sent to supplier
2.	First quote from supplier
3.	NDA is sent to supplier
4.	Signed NDA is sent back
5.	Complete Concept is sent to supplier
6.	Approved Quote is sent back
7.	Order to supplier
8.	Delivers: 	
8.1 Design of template (portal) -> Has to be approved by Fraeulin 
8.2 Design of templates -> Has to be approved Fraeulin
8.3 Complete software with all functions on server for field test with determined users 
by Fraeulin
8.4 Training by telephone
8.5 Documentation
8.6 Approve by Fraeulin

Order to supplier (7) is to be considered at 1st of June 2011.
Delivering of the complete software (8.3) is to be considered at 12th of August 2011. 


1.1.1	Main function of the website
1.	Registration and creating a personal profile with 1 photo and 16 data arrays to be filled out. (9 mandatory, 7 optional / 2 selection boxes, 1 date, 2 klick box, 11 free text fields).
2.	In the registration process of the users: Birthdate is transformed to zodiac, postal code is transformed to residence region (data is available as csv-file).
3.	Sending messages among registered users (messaging system).
4.	For registered users: Publishing ads on the website. The search field contains 11 data arrays (5 selection boxes, 1 date, 5 free text fields).
5.	Search for an ad for registered users. The search field contains 11 data arrays (5 selection boxes, 1 date, 5 free text fields).
6.	View ad (as a result of â€œsearch for an adâ€) and respond to the ad with a message.
7.	For registered users are viewed the following tabs: My profile, my published ads, publish an ad, search for an ad, mailbox.
8.	The administration area contains the following additional tabs: Administrate users, view all ads, sending newsletter to all users, requests (max 5 in the first step).


1.1.2	Requirements
1.	All text modules and inscription of arrays shall be changeable in an easy way. It shall be possible to modify them in separate files or in special templates. If modifications have to be done in the source code, it has to be ensured that the files are found in an easy and structured way. To reduce costs of developing the website I can fill in the text modules (in german language). The programmer is just requested to implement the necessary arrays.
2.	All text modules in emails and messages send to users are editable.
3.	It is possible to embed and few commercial banners on most of the pages. Also it has to be possible to change commercial banners quite easy and to embed the best suitable affiliate programs. 
An optional quote is requested for the following function:
Possibility to implement commercial ads for different regions for defined periods. These ads are viewed only to users who are registered for this region. 
4.	An optional quote is requested for the following function:
Access with smartphones (Apple and Android.
5.	Main target group of the webpage are people in the range of 15 â€“ 35 years of age. So the design of the webpage has to be modern and trendy. Colours shall be conspicuous and memorable. A definite photo or graphic has to show very clearly the purpose of the webpage. However a good performance of the website has a main priority.
6.	Links to Facebook and Twitter have to be implemented.
7.	A daily backup is possible.
8.	Open source software shall be used so that no expensive license costs are necessary.
9.	In further steps an enlargement of the website is intended. So it shall be possible to add further functions to the website, such as chat, changing the language of the whole website, more data arrays for profile, more data arrays for search options, etc.

Through this Email, we convey to introduce you \\"Coop2Coop\\", a concept of social networking which combined with the payment gateway, and has received positive response from the ICA (International Cooperative Alliance) so that the ICA was willing to sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) attached with us, on December 16, 2011 last. For that ICA really want Coop2Coop immediately presented to the Board of ICA in Geneva. 
  
Coop2Coop is our original idea who have initiated by our management, for our current challenge, in serving the 49 million SMEs and 29 million cooperative members in Indonesia to take immediate rise within equality to take global economic opportunity against the increasingly fierce competition, as characteristic of the 21st century. In the same issues which is have by the ICA (International Co-operative Alliance) / www.ica.coop. For how the ICA provides online services to 249 active members of the organization, spread 93 countries, with individual anggotannya nearly 1 (one) billion people. 
  
ICA believes that Coop2Coop idea can provide solutions effectively for building social capital that promote the efficiency of any cost transaction through the ease to interact in a one-stop service (One-stop service) without limit of time and space. So that the SMEs of any corner of the world can be join in the portal Coop2Coop to do interaction and communication as well as transactions without relying on the big companies who had made cartels and monopolies practiced. 
  
To support the Coop2Coop\\\'s infrastructure as a social networking which is going to  able to give one-stop services portal, for 1 (One) billion ICA cooperative members in 93 countries, is a partnership. So, we are looking for a designer and developer to our Social Network \\"Coop2Coop\\" who are going to link and match with financial institution or bank with reputable of worldwide network noperation, long experience, network infrastructure as the payment gateway and once can be a Bank Settlement and act as clearing house in trade finance among ICA members in 93 countries. 

With the above premise, then we can expect establish a broad partnership to support the payment gateway and network portal (design & module) which is being we develop in the of Coop2Coop. 

We believe that through this system that we propose will be able to help monitor, control and payment system and the program we also expect to significantly expand the social basis of activities productive economy and the real sector in general.

My goal is for students to talk to other students about schools they liked and didnâ€™t like. This way incoming students get the real scoop on student life, as opposed to the university handout. This will require that students register; and they must register as looking, attending, or graduated. This way there is little chance of someone who didnâ€™t go to a school and review it. The form for reviewing the school must also auto update on that schools page, and ratings needs to be automatically counted even without a administrative approval. I am not sure how much this will cost or if it available, but is there a directory or list of colleges available and can we obtain them.
Additionally I would also like to have sections where we will have articles and discussion topics to be read. These areas are likely to be mainstream topics and will  be part of the main navigation but, the content will change annually or be updated, so a CMS is a must. Looking for suggestions on CMS and any functionality youâ€™d think would be good. I would like a flash front page, as long as I donâ€™t have to sacrifice being able to be searched or function.

We are a growing website and we are in the preliminary stages of a graphical interface re-design.  Our site front ends complex and multi-featured search functions to our database.  Visitors can tailor their queries to a narrow set of specifics.  

Our database content is centered on an aspect of entertainment and vacationing.  The homepage re-design must be appealing to the visitor who is planning a vacation while at the same time be intuitive so that the casual web surfer will easily understand how to search.  In addition, the site must have a common design theme that will encourage the visitor to remain on the site without it being so distracting that the function becomes overwhelmed by beautiful graphics.

The home page has three search choices, 1) a quick-search, 2) a keyword search, and 3) an advanced search.  The quick-search feature contains one drop list input control and a button.  The keyword search contains a text input control and a button.  The advanced search contains 2 sets of drop list input controls (begin and end dates), 2 drop lists for locations (region and state) â€“ for a grand total of 8 drop lists and 50 check box input controls.  

The challenge is to structure these home page elements into a clear and pleasing design with a measure of color and graphics that will create clarity and appeal without distraction.  In short, simplicity, beauty, functionality, clarity.

We are interested in looking at your portfolio with particular examples that have similarities to our site.

 I am highly interested in your teams Mobile Application development services, we are a medium sized business with a given  pool of clients which we would like to send surveys to at any given time via their mobile handsets. 

 The Application would involve setting up software compatible with both android and apple, allowing the user to participate in a survey we upload to the Application, this should involve some form of web based back-end where the App may be administered, such as adding new surveys, adding content to the survey itself such as sound clips for the user to give options on etc. 

 We would like these completed surveys then compiled and stored in an online database such as sql/mysql for analysis at any given time by Administrators only. 

 Could you please let me know some estimated completion time frames for this development and pricing, bear in mind it must be cross compatible with both Android and Apple iphone. 

If application cannot be done with both Android and iPhone please give me price on one of them your company is able to do it.

 I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Iâ€™m contacting you to check on if you can provide me with a quote for the following project:

2.       The client is basically into the Retail business and they are one of the biggest retailers in the region

3.       As for the features and functionality, currently, we donâ€™t have a clear plan yet about what there should be, but we are open to any suggestions from your front.

4.       The only main feature we are having at the moment is to give the customers who install this application the ability to browse and check all the latest promotions along with also checking the weekly leaflet on the mobile and all the featured and highlighted products.

5.       The mobile application we are looking for should work on android, symbian, blackberry and Iphone.

Can you please send us your suggestions for a mobile application in regards to this industry along with the costing to develop something like this with an applicable timeframe?

Also, can you please send us a reference of any mobile application that you have previously built which falls in the same category of industry which is retail?

If we did agree on the budget and the time frame then the next step would be for us to proceed on with the project immediately, so also can you please inform about if you currently do have the capacity to start on with the project immediately.

If you do have any clarifications, kindly contact us at any time or if you want, we can set a date and time to have a conference call with you to discuss the project in details.

Have a good day and looking forward hearing back from you.

the immediate boost.

We thought you might like to know that we have now expanded our Mobile App Testing services to include Android, Blackberry and Nokia devices. We have a variety of App testing solutions available to suit any budget.


Our list of test devices now includes:

Apple - iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod-Touch, iPad, iPad 2

Android - Google Nexus S, Motorola DroidX, T-Mobile G2, HTC Evo, Sony Ericsson X10, Dell Streak, Samsung Galaxy Tab.....plus, many, many more!

Blackberry - BlackBerry Bold 9700, BlackBerry Bold 9000, BlackBerry Tour 9630, Blackberry Curve.....plus, many, many more!

Nokia - X6, X3, N97, N96, 5800ExpressMusic, E75, E72, E71.....plus, many, many more!



Why Choose Us?

We believe the following features of our mobile App testing services set us apart from any other mobile testing company out there:

We test on real devices

All testing is performed on real devices. We do not perform any test on simulators, ensuring that your App is tested in the same environment that the end user will be using.

We use proven testing techniques

Many App testing services use a \\\'cloud\\\' approach. While this is fine as a method to find simple defects within the App, it is not as effective as a structured test approach. Our testing is performed using our proven App test plan and test cases built up from hundreds of previously successful App testing projects. This highly-effective testing approach digs far deeper into the Apps functionality than a cloud-type test can, and provides much greater test coverage.

We use professional App testers

All App testing performed at Testing4Success is performed by Senior App Testers. Each of our Senior App Testers have a wealth of knowledge in testing mobile Apps. Their experience includes functionality testing, usability testing, performance testing, compatibility testing and much more. All Senior Testers at Testing4Success are also ISEB and ISTQB Certified Testing Professionals. 

We are highly flexible

We ensure our testing services are 100% flexible. Not only can we modify our App testing services to suit your requirements, but we are also flexible with regards to dead-lines. We understand that testing can be a last-minute exercise before an App\\\'s release, and so we make every effort to get you the test results you need, in a matter of hours if you need it.

Contact us today to ensure the quality of your future, or current Mobile Apps!

The idea is to create a website that allows people to update friends or random people about the mood of a club or if they might go there on that day. Every club of a city represent the topic of a forum on which users are allow to upload a picture and update their page status live from the club ( mobie phone apps) or from elsewher via a pc ,to say which club they going to . When entering the club ( topic of forum)you can communicate with people already in that club or those planning to go to that club. For i.e. you can be at home and planning to go to a particular club, you can log in and see what people that are already in the club say about it...or just chat with people that like you, intend to go to the same club. Its a way to revolutionize the way people interact or socialize in clubs and as well pressurize the managers to deliver the best to their customers else they might enter in another club to find out what going on there. Also you can be in the club, single and looking to mingle with another person, the only way to find out if they are willing to speak or looking for someone is for them to get in the forum. With pictures it makes it easy because you know who you talking to. You have the possibility as a user to ignore a conversation meaning you not interested into talking to the person.The website enable you to search clubs by their name or just by entering area code, postcode, city , country.By default the club of your area should appear this through geo tagging, and you have the choice to look for club  by their music type.Its a massive project but the idea is clear in my head, won\\\'t mind working in partnership with you guys to develop the whole idea and concept.

In any case, I\\\'ve got this concept I\\\'ve been putting together for some time, and I\\\'m looking to begin moving on it.  I\\\'ve got a comprehensive (but rough/incomplete) design document and I need to iron out the details and make it more complete.  For the time being, I\\\'m looking to put together a project blueprint / technical documentation and some wire-frames, hopefully in the sub 10K range.  Hopefully this is something you guys can help me with.  After that hopefully we can nail down a firm price to design & develop and we\\\'ll take it from there.

In summary, the service aims to provide meaningful and useful personal expression and collective communication through the use of user-generated closed-ended inquires and the associated anonymous, but defined respondent audience.  Each inquiry will have a customized set of demographic attributes that will uniquely define the respondent audience with respect to the context of each inquiry.  In addition to providing more useful results, because of the ability to analyze the responses with respect to relevant and potentially influential demographics, the associated attributes will allow inquiry posters to loosely target their inquires to the desired audience and provide a more advanced search mechanism for the service, other than just relying on search phase alone.  The information gathered by the inquires will be open to anyone to examine and analyze so the feedback can be put to use by those most interested in the information, and so the respondentsâ€™ feedback can serve them best.  The main goal is to establish the public service so the service can serve as an open resource for social media with potential benefits to the fields of social sciences (politics most notably), health, psychology, marketing, etc.  I think of it as a Wikipedia for social data / information.  However, a private service will be established alongside the public one, so companies and other organizations can use the service for their own benefit outside the public domain.  While establishing public service is my companyâ€™s main goal, the private pay-for service is essential because it will initially sustain the entire service in terms of operation and maintenance costs. Notable similar services that are already established include PollDaddy, BooRoo, Vizu, all which lack a suitable free service for open collective communication because of limitations they impose, such as limiting the amount of respondent feedback, and the inability to openly analyze the results.

So that\\\'s the quick and dirty.  If your interested in the work and you\\\'d like to discuss things further go ahead and shoot me an email and we\\\'ll schedule a time to talk.  Hope to hear from you.

I have plans for a website that provides authors with their very own free social profile page where they can upload their ebook cover, copy, author photo, and bio.

Here\\\'s how it works: The author would sign-up for a free membership account. They would log-in to their account and claim their free social ebook page where they would upload their information into preset fields.

In addition, there would be space to post book reviews and write an optional blog, as well as the ability to upload videos.

The template could look similar to linkedin.com, where the author can upload and edit the fields easily by simply clicking the little â€œeditâ€ link next to each field.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, the template would contain a \\"buy\\" button for a consumer to purchase their ebook. But instead of selling directly from their page, there would be links to where their ebook is presently being sold, such as Amazon and Barnes & Noble. An example of this process may be found on filedby.com at this link: http://filedby.com/author/david_l_hancock/340524/

If you click \\"Buy\\" there is a dropdown menu showing all the places the author\\\'s ebook may be purchased. When you click \\"Amazon\\" for example, the 
link takes you directly to that book\\\'s page on the Amazon site.

Not only will the experience for the buyer need to be simple and easy, but it also needs to be as automatic as possible for the 
author to add such links.

Can this be done? 

Thanks for your time.

I do have Facebook, Twitter and Linked in accounts. However, I still don\'t fully understand how to use them. That said, I\'m also interested in learning the ins and outs, so I can partially work them myself- and of course I\'d be willing to pay you to

teach me, depending on your fee.

 

In short, the more people I can attract to view the site:

www.GrandmaTellMeAStory.com the more it will become a self sustaining business. And the more it earns, the more money I\'ll have available for advertising, social networking and increasing my visibility on the web. You see my over all goal is to spend less and less time on marketing, so that I can have more time to work on and share my stories with others.

Thanks,

 Madeleine

 Below you can find more information regarding my website, along with two teacher recommendations.  I have more recommendations available. 

                  Grandma Tell Me A Story

A website for children who love to listen to stories & fairytales. I believe one of the best ways to teach morality, ethics, and compassion to children, is by touching their heart and capturing their imagination with a good story.

            Parents and teachers can download original story audios with accompanying pdf documents so a child can read and listen. Each story pdf also includes learning activities, fun projects and curriculum ideas for all ages.

            All stories and their accompanying activities and lesson plans, are entirely original, except for my version of â€œGoldilocks & the Three Bears,â€ (the first story I told my granddaughter).

www.grandmatellmeastory.com also has an art gallery where children are

invited to display their illustrations to the stories on line.

The most important function of the arts is to inspire the imagination, so the mind can enter the world of possibility where all forms of invention are born.

            People, who as children learn to question, to visualize and to be independent, creative thinkers, are our greatest defense against tyranny.

 

 

TEACHERâ€™S RECOMMENDATIONS

 

I am a third grade teacher at Malcolm X Elementary school, and this year had the pleasure of inviting Madeleine Sklar into my classroom to share her captivating stories with my students.

Upon my request for a story to complement our studies of Native Americans, Madeleine wrote wonderful chapter book called, "Hummingbird and Red Fox," and read it aloud to my class. The students were captivated by her skillful, engaging storytelling. Afterwards, Madeleine invited each of the students to illustrate part of the book. The students were thrilled to see their illustrations in the finished books, which Madeleine printed for each student to take home.

The story of â€œHummingbird and Red Fox,â€ would be of interest to children ages 7 to 12.

Madeleine\'s stories brought our area of study to life, and kept all of my students on the edge of their seats. She is a talented story-teller and writer, with a gift for igniting children\'s imaginations!

To Whom it May Concern,

It is an honor to write this review for a great storyteller.  

Madeleine Sklar captivates her audience with her incredible stories and makes an art form of the telling.  Mrs. Sklar has provided students and teachers in the Berkeley Unified School District  with her distinctive talent keeping this wonderful oral tradition alive. In addition  Mrs. Sklar provides a full lesson plan for the teacher and the opportunity for each student to illustrate her stories.  Her repertoire includes myths, fables, and fairy tales.

   As a storyteller Mrs. Sklar is able to deliver her unique insight into humanity. Her writing is powerful, evocative, motivating, insightful, entertaining.  Her potential  influence as a storyteller is obvious. Her wonderful imagination, words, body language, facial expressions, and interpretations, makes the stories she creates both engaging and relevant to today\'s children.

   Please, feel free to contact me if you need to know more about Mrs. Sklarâ€™s talents and achievements.

Madeleine Sklar shared her story â€œDiego and Lucaâ€ with my kindergarten class. Since her stories have no pictures, the children had to imagine the illustrations in their mind as they were exposed to actual storytelling. She beautifully captured my studentsâ€™ attention though vivid descriptions of the forest, a boy and his dog, a fire, and how the two heroes were able to save the trees from destruction. The theme of the story blended well with our landforms and natural elements\' unit we had been studying. Madeleine uses call and response and some other interactive body motions to further engage the kids. This helped them visualize the setting, characters, and plot even further. After she finished reading, the class collectively illustrated the book so each child could have their own copy. My students enjoyed seeing their own work in a "real" book. 

The story of â€œDiego and Luca,â€ would be of interest to children ages 4 to 7. I found Madeleineâ€™s story a useful tool for teaching how to â€œshowâ€ not â€œtellâ€ a story. Her story inspired a series of readers theater and other storytelling techniques, including puppets. The process also showed my students that a story can be shared through only words OR only pictures - really distinguishing the power between the two - and once put together, bring the story to life. Lastly, and simply put, this experience allowed my kids the opportunity to connect with a community member and broaden their exposure of the world.

 

Thank you!

Did you ever wonder who that certain person was walking into your college dorm or another dorm on campus?Wonder no longer. Through the new social networking site I would like to create a free membership way for kids in college to sign in and click their school and narrow it down even to the dorm that they are in. In each dorm you click I would like a chat room to appear. This could make it easy for kids in college to talk about school, parties and everything else kids talk about. Also I would like it to be able to have personal conversations as well. Once becoming a member each user acct comes with a small profile with a single picture name school year and major (possibly hobby). If you want to you could also broaden your search to network with other school in your area and possibly have high school kids look into schools through this website. I know that if i was in college still and I had a website designed just for my school networking and meeting kids in my dorm I WOULD LOVE IT.
What do you think? 
And what kind of prices could you offer... I\\\'m young and have this idea but not the money to back it up so investors would be manditory.

Whether this application would be used for mobile devices, Facebook, or both would be something that would make a lot more sense to you guys. 

I was thinking about Facebook\\\'s use in communication and realized that it doesn\\\'t have an application that can make relationship building even easier. To specify, an application that notifies you if someone is interested in you. One of the hardest things for people to do is letting a person know how they fell about them because of the chances of getting turned down. Perhaps technology can make that a little less awkward and easier.

Let\\\'s say person \\"A\\" likes person \\"B\\". \\"A\\" tells the application (that serves as the middle man). If \\"B\\" were to ever tell the application that he/she likes \\"A\\", then the application would be alarmed that a match is made and both parties would get notified.

Here\\\'s the beauty, when A let\\\'s the application know, B is never notified. So there\\\'s no \\"awkward or shut down moment\\". If A never gets a match, he/she can just go on knowing that only the application knows and not the other party. Then they can go on trying in person or keep their feelings to themselves but the only time the parties are notified is if there\\\'s a match. 

So essentially not just one party can be notified, because you have to have a match. As much as a part of me hates this concept because its another step away from face to face communication - there\\\'s no denying that people would be all over it.

Hope you are well, its been quite a while! I recently changed fitnessrace to distancetracker.com and I have a question for you. I just did a business consultation and we came up with some ideas on how to change the site. You might recall I have a pretty complex flash front end, but I\\\'m not using it right now due to a few issues. They also highly recommended a smartphone app to go along with it. 

So I thought about all your services and the fact I really love your quality graphical work you always do. I have just a few questions..

1. Is your current flash programmer pretty good? I ask because my flash coding is pretty complicated, they would need to know how to do mysql pulls through flash. Flashbooty designed my site and one thing I know is they can do anything possible with flash, so I just want to make sure your programmers are very flash savvy.

2. Would you do the design work? I need to change my look - here it is currently - http://www.fitnessrace.com/flash/index.php  - I think it needs to be softened, and of course there are changes that I will map out for you. Whatever look you establish here I will match with my back-end sites. I really want to ensure you do the \\"look\\" design of the site.

3. Can you create smart-phone app to interface with my back-end mysql database? 

This will really help me as I\\\'m working on a plan to get the site to where I think it needs to be. I know you\\\'ll need more details for a quote but needed to start with these questions.

Thanks!

Users should be able to leave feedback for the sellers and some sort of rating. No physical products will need to be listed, just services with descriptions. Sellers should have an \\"about me\\" type profile and be able to list qualifications for their services. Ideally users would be able to search by qualifications within location searches, too.  Features such as \\"featured sellers\\" would ultimately be desirable as well. It\\\'d be helpful to talk to someone personally about my ideas.

Let me introduce myself as Prof. Girishma Rai, a Marketing Management Professor at Management College of Nasik. Our college is delivers all the courses of business management. Its one of the upcoming institute in Nasik. 

This institute was established five years back. Within this short span it has established itself and introduced many new diploma and post graduate distance learning programs. Its core strength lies in identifying new sectors and providing quality education in those areas like Retail, E-Biz, Design & Innovation and Commodity Trading among others.

We believe in excellence in quality of education which is relevant to the current times. Our faculty is of the best calibre. The curriculum is designed and updated regularly by our faculty along with experienced practicing managers, who take special care to keep it application oriented.

The Institute is committed to produce outstanding managers with broad based knowledge, analytical ability, team experience and critical interpersonal skills necessary to meet today\\\'s and tomorrow\\\'s management challenges.

Emerging unarticulated needs and realities need a new approach both in terms of thought as well as action. Cross disciplinary learning, discovering, scrutinizing, prototyping, learning to create and destroy-the mind\\\'s eye needs to be nurtured and differently so.

We are promising institute who has no website of its own. As we wish to market ourselves globally and compete with other institute by providing finest education, self has approached you to develop Social Networking Website for us.

I need a Social marketplace that allows students, potential students, alumni and other key stakeholders to communicate, involve them in campus life, recruitment and retention of the student body, promotion of activities and events, and strengthening ties to the university.

I anticipate your approach on this. Also I would like to inform you that our estimated budget to developing the site is appx USD. 25000

I have done my research on social network developing companies for last 3 months and have shortlisted few companies for development of our site.

Hope to hear from you soon. 

Thanking you in advance

Best Wishes
Girishma

After the test run in October and November we wanted to start at least 2 months of aggressive social media and PR service for December and January for the spring semester and quarters.  
During the test run period of October and November we will be focusing on getting most of the other major booksellers while getting more and more students to upload whatever book they have to rent out for the following semester or quarter in January to increase our inventory.

Our intention now is to take down the current site and put up a coming soon page with a refreshed logo, a new mascot and a facebook like button so that we can start generating a little buzz while increasing our facebook fan base.

I wanted to know if you would be able to put a package together for December and January.

 A company administrator can add a business partner (organization or individual) as a friend and use the platform to share information and marketting. Messages can be sent out to specific industries from a friend list. eg, \\"Joes Hardware,\\" can send out a message to all his clients in the \\"construction\\" category only...

An advertising platform so companies can advertise in a side bar at a rate... perhaps per click billing or a monthly flat fee....

When I was ready to decide to hire a New York company specializing in the Drupal platform.  I did one last search on google and thanks to God I found them.

I have reviewed all the information about your excellent company and would like to request its services.
I created a social network  project unique and highly competitive, and want to build your platform.

Request a cost proposal for the full development of my social network.
I am interested in all the services: web platform, mobile platforms, multilingual, web hosting, support, management, updating and marketing or SEO.

I want to work and partner with  Pearse Street Inc.  for development and global success Livezones.
It is a large-scale project in the style of facebook, but superior in concept, contents and modules.

I created a prototype of my social network with different characteristics, zones, modules, menus, pages and contents, in addition to my own design, layout or theme.
It is a great project which will be released as soon as possible, to compete with the large in this market.

But before making a decision I have several questions:
1)  Pearse Street Inc. allows a customization from scratch to implement 100% my prototype with all its features, modules and contents, in addition to my own design or layout?
2)  Pearse Street Inc.  has all services: development, hosting, support, management, marketing and SEO?
3)  Pearse Street Inc.  will provide me with future software updates to platform?
4)  Future versions of the platform may be implemented without affecting the stable operation of my social network?
5)  Pearse Street Inc. allows me to build a social network as polished, agile and efficient as facebook?
6)  Pearse Street Inc.  can develop a similar function microblogging to twitter?
7) Pearse Street practice a strong policy of confidentiality and intellectual property protection of its customers?

But to show the prototype  it is necessary to sign before a Confidentiality Agreement or NDA.
I need the name of the CEO of Pearse Street Inc. who would sign the NDA and guaranteed compliance.

We are interested in all the services offered by  Pearse Street Inc.,  addition to its experience, quality and professionalism of your work team.  
It is our interest to partner with Pearse Street Inc. for the development and launch of the project Livezones Social Network.

 I need a team of high quality and experince in the development of social applications and specialists in social networking platforms. 
To master all the features and modules of the Social Platform | Enterprise Platform | Professional | Social E-commerce.

This project is of extreme importance and monitored by investors.
Their global success will depend on the quality of work for Pearse Street Inc. and its development team.

We\\\'re discussing quotes with a few different firms, but we do like your work very much.

Essentially, we\\\'re attempting to build a social networking site that connects artists -- visual artists, filmmakers, musicians, writers, you name it -- with other artists for collaborative projects. Imagine a film student in Florida who wants to make a short film, but lacks a screenplay. Somewhere out there, someone is writing scripts and would love to see one turned into a film. Or a girl in Nebraska who would love to write a comic but can\\\'t draw and the illustrator in Washington who can\\\'t come up with a story and characters. We want to enable the lyricist who hates singing with the vocalist who has no interest in songwriting. You name it; you can come up with a billion examples. The point is, we want to give people a platform to collaborate creatively with other creatives, no matter where they are. 

The specifics get more detailed, as do our long-term goals, but for this initial quote, I\\\'ll say that we require the following features:

1) Profiles that showcase the user\\\'s artistic identity -- portfolios, basically. Users should be able to post images, words, video, and audio to their portfolio. Standard users should have a limited amount of space available, but can purchase more by upgrading their account. Which also brings us to:
2) Tiered users.
3) The \\"Workshop\\": Users can post their idea for a project, what they\\\'re going to bring to it, and what they\\\'re looking for in collaborators. Search functionality for users to search for both artists and projects that are suitable matches for them. (Ideally, artists can tag themselves in both specific and general ways - i.e. \\"musician\\" is fine, as well as \\"guitarist\\", since project creators might have specific or general desires. Project creators can use those same tags in their project description to identify what kind of artists they\\\'re looking for.)
4) Once the project\\\'s participants have connected, they can mark the project as working, which opens a \\"Studio\\", a workspace for them to post messages and files. These should be private among collaborators (though the project creator should be able to add/subtract people as they go along.)
4)  A content rating system. Completed collaborative projects can be released to the community, and users can rate that on a scale of 1 to 10. 

Once we get rolling, we\\\'d like to showcase and celebrate the most loved work on a regular basis. For example, a weekly podcast featuring that week\\\'s highest rated collaborative music projects (and, eventually, a CD compilation release). An periodic DVD of the best short films. Print editions of literature and visual art. You get the idea.

I will spare you the more long-winded, specific, detailed needs of the network -- for now we\\\'d be very appreciative for a general quote.

I\\\'m contacting you from Kalani, which is a 501(c)(3) charity located in the poorest district in Hawaii. We are the largest NGO providing services to this impoverished community. Much of our funding comes from social enterprise, which is our retreat center, and is then funneled into educational programs for the community, preservation of Hawaiian culture and archaeological sites, and modeling sustainable community and agricultural practices. Our retreat center is about 50% yoga, and the rest is a wide diverse selection of performing arts, esoteric studies, cultural experiences, and nature/adventure.

In order to continue our services, we are looking for ways to better support facilitators, teachers, and leaders.  We have a large database of facilitators who love Kalani; we want to provide them with educational resources to help build their skills (which would support our educational mission.)  To do so, we would like to build a social network for this niche, which would be the \\"LinkedIn\\" of facilitators (but much simpler, clearly!)

As a 501(c)(3) charity, we are unable to put cash to the project, but we are able to provide tax receipt for the full commercial value (i.e. at your top rates) of any work you provide, as well as services in-kind or in-trade (such as stays here at Kalani.)

I am very happy to further explore opportunities - I have plenty of experience using these methods with for-profit organizations such as yours to get things done in the charitable sector - and make it still be a profitable, viable WIN for your business.

I look forward to speaking with you,

My name is Nayia Moysidis. I am the founder and President of a new web-based company, a passionate start-up aiming to give the members of the literary community the tools to interact while enhancing their careers.  We have acquired funding from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and are now looking to create and launch our website.  We have quite a few offers from programmers to fill the Lead Software Engineer slot, but time is of the essence, so we are leaning towards hiring an experienced development team to build the first version of our site.  We are seeking a development team that is able to create our social network by October 1st.  

Though we are based in NYC, I will be in MA on Wednesday, August 17th and am able to meet and discuss the concept in person. Please let me know if this is possible.  The concept is quite complex to explain through message.

Thanks for your time.

I\\\'m a recent college graduate (Tufts University, over in Medford) looking to build a web startup.  My idea is very, very good and has a high potential for success.  The only real problems are that I have little knowledge of web development (and business for that matter).  I need a solid, working prototype of my site before I can take it to any investors, but lack the capabilities to develop said prototype on my own.  

I am hesitant to give full details about my project because it is still in the idea-stage and can\\\'t really be protected.  However, i can say that it should operate like a mix between YouTube and Facebook, with users having individual profile pages onto which they can upload videos, photos, etc. It may also need to have a dash of eBay, with people being able to purchase and bid on those photos and videos.  Of course, this may sound generic, but my company targets a niche that is ripe for success.  

I\\\'m currently based in New York, and was wondering if and how you can be of service.  Do you have experience working with startups?  Do you simply build someone a website and leave, or do you have any interest in becoming a part of (investor, e.g.) the startup?  Would you be able to use the new html <video> standard, or would you use a flashplayer like youtube?  

I\\\'m also hesitant to really go nuts writing about this because I\\\'m not sure if my budget can really pay for your professional services.   Either way, I thought I\\\'d ask and would love to hear what you have to say.  

Sincerely,

The current site has a vendor listings section, marketplace and a forum. The issue first lies in the fact that some of the pages come off as cartoony or very bland and basic. They were supposed to have professional looking pages (especially the sign up pages) with graphics and text.

There was also supposed to be a forum that was integrated with the websites memberships of brides, but instead I received a separate registration needed. I am looking to take down the marketplace for the time being while we build up traffic when the site launches and I am looking to take down the forum until a time where it can be integrated and not simplistic.

Other additions that are needed:

~the site was supposed to have vendor questionnaires upon sign up that would require the vendors to answer all the same questions that the brides would be asked so that the site could show brides vendors based upon a percentage that they match their wants and needs for their wedding.
~ There needs to be the ability to put ads on the website, and thus far, that isn\\\'t there.
~ I need the ability to upload and archive articles and blog posts
~ I need to be able to modify the homepage when we upload new items for the brides without having to go to a web design company.
~ The site needs to email members (vendors and brides) when they sign up with their registration information
~ The member interface needs to be updated to a more professional appearance and more functionality that benefits the user and the site.

There are more projects and ideas that I want to ad to the site but that is a start. The budget for the site is undetermined at the moment because depending on price we could do all of the ideas or some of them. I am most interested in getting the vendor listings working so that we can get vendors on the site and get it launched in beta to get feedback from the users. I am also looking for a company that can guarantee a completion date of the updates (I know I need to be accountable for response times to any questions asked) because the past company was over two months late with the project initially and then it just kept getting later and later.

I look forward to speaking with you. Due to my current work schedule my hours are very abnormal so the best way for initial questions and conversations is via Email, but if needed I can schedule time in to be awake and available for phone communications.

My name is Russ Rosenband and I am a Senior at Hamilton College in Clinton, NY.  A few buddies and I have come up with a potential application idea that we believe has great potential.  We have been speaking with a number of application development companies and are searching for the right company with the right price for our idea.  We have received great feedback from our friends and family, as well as the Entrepreneurship Venture Capitalist Committee at Hamilton.  

We were intrigued by your website and would love to speak further about our potential project.

I would like to interview you, preferably via email for the Digital Marketing Institute website (www.digitalmarketinginstitute.co.uk) about social media and how to use it to its maximum, clearly you are an expert in the field and this would provide tremendous value to our readers.

In return your interview will feature two links back to your site, a profile picture of yourself or company logo, we will publish the interview directly to our thousands of email newsletter subscribers (not just in the UK) and our thousands of Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook followers.

I believe it will generate traffic and revenue for you and I am sure it will provide a valuable insight into an experts opinion for our readers.

I am currently looking into different options to develop a beauty community and review website. The design was done in a \\\'magazine-style\\\' in photoshop and should stay as close as possible to it. I am looking to get an approximate
quote on how much this project would cost. 
I want to have the directory of salons linked to the community in a way that
a user can ask where to go for a certain salon and the community can
answer him (possibly also to post it out to facebook/twitter but that is not critical)
For the community I am also looking for a functionality to create lookbooks for users to drop in images from across the web - similar to imgspark.com - if this is at all possible. 

Here is a breakdown of the navigation overview: 


Splash Page 					The splashpage has only the footer nav, not the top nav and is not the actual index.html for SEO reasons 
        
              Top Nav					
		  home: articles - overview		 = Index.html: slideshow at the top with 3 categories
		  salon directory				1. Cityvisuals should be at the top, listings follow with visuals at bottom like in original  designs
		  community				        2. Community Page: Login page to change and profile to reflect original designs
		  interviews				         3. Interview page: has a slideshow at the top with 3 select interview images and underneath categories
						
	       Bottom Nav					
		  interviews				        same as above
		  community				        same as above
		  salon directory			        same as above
		  how it works				Page which explains all elements with images and some javascript functionality

This is an unusual opportunity.

The team must be able to emulated Zyngaâ€™s accomplishments, and their approach to addressing the challenges of a FarmVille-like network environment, as outlined below:
â€¢	Must scale fast and far to multiple millions of members
â€¢	Within six months expect 2M to 5M daily players
â€¢	Very rapid user growth
â€¢	Open source components built on LAMP stack
â€¢	User\\\'s state to contain a huge amount of data with subtle and complex relationships
o	Within the network objects cannot collide
o	If player places a object on their game field, backend verifies object does not overlap with other objects
o	Extremely heavy write workload, ratio of data reads to writes 3:1
o	Majority of the requests hitting the backend in some way modifies the state of the user playing the game
o	Network is made scalable through application interacting primarily with cache components
o	Must be able to accommodate huge traffic spikes caused by new content and features
â€¢	Must address latency and performance variances
o	Heavily cache Facebook data
o	Must be able to ratchet back usage of the platform when performance degradation is apparent
o	Requires a cluster of caching servers to handle traffic between network and the Facebook platform
o	When performance varies, the application can dynamically turn off any calls back to the platform.
o	Calls back to the platform must avoid blocking the loading of the application so players can continue to play
â€¢	To address the high latency a high level of caching is needed in front of high latency components
â€¢	Highly variable latency caused by heavy write and transaction workload
o	Every single component is dealt with as a degradable service, such as Memcache, Database, REST APIs, etc.
o	 Isolate troubled and highly latent services through the use of error and timeout throttling, and if needed, disable functionality in the application using on/off switches and functionality based throttles.
â€¢	Utilize open source monitoring and management tools, such as Nagios for alerting, Munin for monitoring, and Puppet for configuration.
â€¢	Utilize internal stats systems to track performance of the services the application uses, such as Facebook, DB, and Memcache
â€¢	To address performance degradation, a request\\\'s IO events on a sampled basis.

I am available to meet in Salem with your experts if this is of interest. A mutual non-disclosure will be necessary.

Having 5 different levels of society within the site - each member will be assigned a member number when joining & depending on the members activity, behavior, or what they have to offer the site - they can move up a level - or down if that be the case. Each level of society will have a different color borerlining each members profile or profile picture. Each level of society also will offer different & better options or perks as this is a type of reward for the member for moving up a level. I - as site owner will offer to the first 3 members who bring 100,000 members to the site a 5% share of profit for 2 years & then the next 3 members will follow for 2 years. New members recruited by members will join giving the recruiting members ID number. On top of this every 6 months the site will reward a 3% profit check for six months to 1 member that has been most active on the site - this is achieved by making friends, socializing, recruiting & good behavior. along with a like type button on posts & a comment button - there needs to be a drama button. should one member repeatedly hit anothers alot - interaction between them 2 members will be suspended for a week. should a certain amt. of different people - lets say 50 members find one members posts to be too much drama - that member will get a week suspension from posting. A sidebar will be seen on homepage allowing all members to see the activity of each different society - active members, most activity in what areas of the site - so on & so forth. different perks to each level of society have yet to be determined. I do not feel the site owner or owners are the only ones who should gain from profit of a social network. this could all be run on a type of point system or something similar for achievments. This is my rough draft to you for the idea of my social network - the peak life span of a good social network in my opinion seems roughly 10 years - it is time for a new good one. one that everyone has a chance to profit from.','status' => '0','datestamp' => '1315965321','followup' => '0','packet' => '0','call' => '0','user_id' => '0'),

It will obviously have the standard social networking features like user profiles Messenging/picture sharing/commenting/friend requesting & chat. Some of the other features I want I will list below, what I wanna know is if all these desired features are possible, & if so what a site like this would run, I wanna get a cost estimate for this project as soon as possible, because I am on a time crunch to get this started, cause I have a closing window of opportunity to get an agreement with the owner of the domain name I want/need. Once I can get a cost estimate I can than turn to some personal investors I know for funding. Thank you guys & Hope to hear from you soon.

LIST OF DESIRED FEATURES:

Video Chat

my name is Ayano, Managing Director of Bling My Thing Group. We are a company founded in Berlin Germany, specialised in \\\'blinging\\\' things with SWAROVSKI ELEMENTS. Lately our business focus has been shifting from providing custom crystallisation services to selling crystal cases for mobile phones like iPhone. I would say, \\\'please visit our website for more information\\\' but you will be probably confused because it is a mess! We would love to get someone to re-design our website/blog/webshop etc. I am wondering if you can provide me with some more information!

Basically, we want to make our mobile phone cases as our primary products, which are presented in the website. This is what everyone should see when they come to our website on the first page. We are no longer interested in providing all the custom bling services. Right now the main website is still in flash and there is hardly any info on the iPhone cases. These are more or less in the webshop, which is in html. Now that the new iPhone is coming and our branding is more and more associated with Swarovski iPhone cases, we really want everything to be integrated, while shifting old stuff like a \\\'museum\\\' of Bling My Thing. I still do not mind using some images to \\\'show off\\\' - but the emphasis should be on mobile phone cases.

As far as our website goes, here is a summary.
We have an old, user-unfriendly flash site which was made several years ago in Berlin. built on XT-Commerce platform, we have already disabled the shop system here because it was just not working. They have build a blog with Wordpress but the design is horrible, I hate it! in any case, there is no element of connecting us to social networking platforms.... I try to write things more personally, adding more pictures.  
3 years ago we started to move away from custom blinging business to selling iPhone cases with crystals. It was really important that we would come up with a html website with an easier navigation system. So we had someone design a separate shop using Prestashop as a platform, which goes under www.bling-my-thing.com/shop. it\\\'s OK, but there are few things missing:
social networking links
interactive contents
videos etc
we have a Facebook page with a bit over 300 likes. nobody took care of it and I would love to have it customised professionally. ideally, I would like to be connected to our shop/website and have more active interactions with users.
the worst thing here: everything we have right now is not really integrated. we have an ugly start site which prompts users to go to our webshop, but in fact, they should be seen all the mobile phone cases straight away. 
it is important that the new website will be also suitable for mobile navigation. we need it to be fully integrated with Facebook/Twitter/YouTube/Blog.

I am not web-technology savvy so may be you can also suggest some cool new features we could consider implementing.

As far as the budget goes, I really do not know how much such services can cost these days. If it is worth it, we are willing to invest. So please point me towards the right direction.

Thank you very much!

best regards,
Ayano

     I am Leena, Seo consultant and a proud member of Webmasterworld for over 8 years, with all my experience I have served so many happy clients. 

Finally Google has shut all the doors for building natural links. And quality links are the only way to improve your rankings. As an owner of http://www.pearsestreet.com may know there is almost nothing that can be considered as on page optimization magic that others don\\\'t know. It is all about links. But you only see all your link building efforts turned down or no followed in spite of having great content.

In this situation if you really want to improve your ranking from 16th position for mobile application development the only way is to buy highly relevant links with good PR. 

With all my experience and good relationship with my existing seo clients, I can help you buy quality links at very affordable rates.

What I can promise is...

01. Highly relevant links that can pass maximum PR.
02. Assured link count(less than 10) for all time on a given page.
03. Sites not affected by Google Panda Update.
04. Sites with authority status, minimum 4 years old.
05. Links will be directly acquired from the website owner no network involved.
06. And other list of guidelines I bother on behalf of you.


Hope you don\\\'t want miss a genuine quality link building service with affordable price and promising results. Email me at leenajosee@gmail.com

I am developing my website www.gurumate.com which is a social networking site and need few php developers to enhance the experience of my visitors. There are few tasks that I am looking forward to get developed from the well experienced php developers at a cheap rate. 
First of all I would like you to visit my website and register to see the current features and then check if my demands will be fulfilled. 

Please let me know if this would be possible for you to take it forward. Also how many days will it take to complete the project and what would be the charges for the same. Please note that my budget is  upto $2500 for everything that I need for my social networking site. Believe me itâ€™s not going to be so easy so please reply me only if you think your company is capable of doing within the stipulated timeframe. 
Regards

On top of this users must be able to upload videos. the videos must be all on a separate part of the users profile and all the videos can be commented on and there will need to be a custom rating system for the videos. It can be looked at as a cross between facebook and youtube.
So people can search for a user to use the site like facebook or search for a video to use the site like youtube.

There will be other custom features need.

Is this something you can do?

Revenue is derived from flat monthly advertising fees paid by the businesses listed on our site. Unlike craigslist or yellowpages.com, we\\\'re aiming for a bit of exclusivity on our site, we\\\'re allowing only 4 businesses per industry. 

Starting off we cover 36 categories and will expand to meet our users needs over time. Those categories include but not limited to: Accountants, Attorneys, Bankers, Contractors, Delivery Services, Designers, Electricians, Personal Trainers, Painters, Landscapers, etc, etc. The list goes on, essentially every service or business the typical household has a need for. 

Now once the customer logs onto rList.com, they will select their city of residency, next they would select the industry they\\\'re interested in, we then provide them with the top 4 options within their city. (only 4 accountants, 4 attorneys, 4 bankers, 4 contractors, etc, etc.) We plan to only list accredited, bonded and licensed businesses with a trusted reputation. rList.com will always be free to the visitors, our revenue is derived from our flat marketing fee to the businesses listed.

Once businesses are directed to our site, they create a user ID, log on and create a profile. Providing us with website links, bonding, insurance, licensing information and payment method. Initially we\\\'ll be offering a free month to get the businesses signed up but a valid payment method will need to be on file. Once the free month has past, the payment method will be charged.

Now you may be asking yourself why would someone use our site rather than a more known company like Yellow Pages, Google, etc. Honestly those are both great resources however I invite you to search electricians in Los Angeles, you\\\'ll have a list of 48 pages with electricians that may or not my worthy of a top ranking. When you visit rList and search electricians, only 4 come up. The top 4, not in price but in quality of their work. You\\\'re given the \\"rList promise\\" all the businesses listed are bonded, insured and licensed with real customer testimonals left by previous rList users., ','status' => '0','datestamp' => '1319001723','followup' => '0','packet' => '0','call' => '0','user_id' => '0'),

Simultaneously, the site will function as an aggregator for Angel and Venture Capital Investors to discover untapped talent. 


The value of NDVRS is that the site fills a gap that currently exists out there for college students. College provides a fertile ground for the development of ideas. Yet oftentimes these ideas never mature beyond discussion amongst friends. This problem can come from a lack of guidance, or simply a lack of funding. NDVRS enables college students to launch their endeavors without fear of financial repercussions. All that is required is a .edu email address. Students can then provide visitors with a snapshot of their idea, their stated goals, and incentives for investment. Students can choose to provide products/services from their completed company to firm equity. The site makes it as easy for a student to launch the next Mint.com as it is to fund a venture to a different company. 
In addition, to ease of use for college students, the site will also be an easy to use portal for friends, family, faculty, and finders (those looking for projects) to discover the various projects. The site provides an easy way to track all NDVRSâ€™s and will allow the user to follow their NDVRSâ€™s by including them in a simplified NDVRS portfolio.

We\\\'re trying to secure a partner for a new online marketing platform called rList.com, otherwise known as Recommended List. Unlike craigslist or yellowpages.com, we\\\'re aiming for a bit of exclusivity on our site, we\\\'re allowing only 4 businesses per industry. 

Starting off we cover 36 categories and will expand to meet our users needs over time. Those categories include but not limited to: Accountants, Attorneys, Bankers, Contractors, Delivery Services, Designers, Electricians, Personal Trainers, Painters, Landscapers, etc, etc. The list goes on, essentially every service or business the typical household has a need for. 

Now once the customer logs onto rList.com, they will select their city of residency, next they would select the industry they\\\'re interested in, we then provide them with the top 4 options within their city. (only 4 accountants, 4 attorneys, 4 bankers, 4 contractors, etc, etc.) We plan to only list accredited, bonded and licensed businesses with a trusted reputation. rList.com will always be free to the visitors, our revenue is derived from our flat marketing fee to the businesses listed. ($99 monthly) 


Once businesses are directed to our site, they create a user ID, log on and create a profile. Providing us with website links, bonding, insurance, licensing information and payment method. Initially we\\\'ll be offering a free month to get the businesses signed up but a valid payment method will need to be on file. Once the free month has past, the payment method will be charged.

Now you may be asking yourself why would someone use our site rather than a more known company like Yellow Pages, Google, etc. Honestly those are both great resources however I invite you to search electricians in Los Angeles, you\\\'ll have a list of 48 pages with electricians that may or not my worthy of a top ranking. When you visit rList and search electricians, only 4 come up. The top 4, not in price but in quality of their work. You\\\'re given the \\"rList promise\\" all the businesses listed are bonded, insured and licensed with real customer testimonals left by previous rList users.

I came across Pearse Street while researching potential developers for a website we are looking to create. We are a small yet successful software development company that is looking to expand some of its projects into the nonprofit world. Our founders are very passionate about giving back and we are looking to build a nonprofit organization that helps individuals cope with traumatic life events and which also connects them with available resources. As a part of this foundation, we will need to create a social networking website that helps bridge the gap between professionals and our constituents. This would potentially utilize almost all of the available features you have listed under your social networking framework and may include some custom features as well. 

I look forward to hearing from you and discussing our project further. Please let us know what you need from our end to put together a quote.

As a capital owner or venture capitalist you can engage with these features and have proper profile pages where you are able to have video presentations of the company, dispose available capital to invest, go to a specific market where idea owners demonstrate their projects (something like an ebay of ideas). You can either establish online contracts with these idea owners for funding purposes without having to meet in presence.
I would like to know how much will it cost to create from scratch a social network like this, and the price to do the same, as applications to integrate with a social network created on \\"www.ning.com\\" trough their API program.


I hope i had explained it well and cant wait to hear soon from you.

May this message find you well.

We are currently looking to partner with an innovative web-design company that may be interested in building our vision for equity in our start-up venture. The outline for the website architecture is well detailed in our business plan, and we are seeking a partner that can make it a reality (along with additional creative insight to enhance it\\\'s success). If this is something that interests you and can be done, I would love to set up a meeting in your home office to discuss the possibilities. Our innovative business model is in the healthcare arena. Please feel free to reach out to me anytime to discuss and set up a face-to-face meeting.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

I am looking for help building a mobile web app which will lead a walking tour. There needs to be a main page for the tour, and then individual pages for each physical site (approximately 20-30 sites total). The site pages need an embeded media player for audio or video and an ability to link to social sharing sites and display a real time feed. 

There also needs to be additional pages with google maps for directions between sites or even better a way to pull up the device\\\'s native app with GPS.

The site also needs to a way to accept credit card payments and other types of payment.

I am also looking for a way to partially restrict access. I need a first time visitor to one of the site pages to be able to access the content, but when they attempt to move forward to the next site and another page I need them to be redirected to the payment page. Once they pay they need to have full access to the site with little or no additional effort on their part.

I am looking more for the bones/structure/code of the site than for the full package with graphic design etc.

I hope that is enough information for a rough quote. Please let me know.

What im looking for from a programming perspective is a mini twitter where a group signs up rather than an individual, under the guise of a dating website.  The sign up sheets are very simple because I want this to have the fastest account initiation of any dating site - less than a dozen fields to fill in.

There ofcourse will be messaging capability, but I donâ€™t want to claim that it does any matching whatsoever (simpler and way cheaper for programming Iâ€™m assuming)..  Just search for good looking groups in your area, follow them, shoot them a messageâ€¦  A cool thing will be if your following a group of single girls on the site and they post that theyâ€™ll be at ABC Bar downtown that night, you could at least get your friends and be like I know where thereâ€™s gonna be a couple single chicks tonight hahaâ€¦ Obviously I would like the design to be catchy, super simple, not too busy and doesnâ€™t look cheapâ€¦    I have a website that I want to mimic in relation to the look of the siteâ€¦ I have a logo that I want that to be incorporated in to the overall feel â€“ I would like to potentially use a black and white photo with accents in the main color of the logo that I would like to integrateâ€¦  The website I want the new site to look somewhat like is http://www.36bottles.co.nz/ â€¦ Not sure yet weather a fully functioning dating application will work or if I need a full blown website, we can talk about that when I hear back from you guys i supposeâ€¦  Thanks for your time

I am a small business owner with a business that is now 3 years old.  The business has achieved strong growth over its 3 year life.  I have made it thus far without having much in the way of social media marketing (e.g. some LinkedIn presence, but Facebook/Twitter is non-existent to my business at this point).  I know this needs to change before I get any further behind the times as my competitors are using these avenues (or at least appear to have more of a presence).  The problem is that, while i do understand what these social media outlets do, I don\'t necessarily understand how they can be utilized effectively/efficiently to improve my overall marketing strategy.  I need help in this area.  I am putting out feelers to a few firms to get an idea of what can be done and costs involved.  I am not envisioning a huge campaign, but more of an establishment of a presence in these arenas and effective strategy, given my type of business and overall strategy.

Thanks,

Nate

Can you give me a quote? A more detailed description of the site and some of its features is below.

Ben

MyMaryland.net is a new non-partisan, non-profit website to connect Maryland residents with their elected officials to facilitate participation and create a more responsive government. The site is coming soon for spring 2012 and is being led by UMD students, mainly in from the Government and Politics department.
 
MyMaryland.net makes having your voice heard easy, meaningful, and social. You\\\'ll be able to...
-Vote on bills to advise your representatives
-View and discuss your representatives\\\' floor speeches and campaign finance info
-Ask your representatives questions
-Write open letters and circulate petitions
-Build your network
 
We hope to help improve the health of our democracy by boosting participation, accountability and transparency. Our goal is to be the first website to get elected representatives and their constituents to engage in a continuous open forum. If we can prove the site concept here in Maryland, we want to go national and help fix our political system by bringing the power back to the American people.','status' => '4','datestamp' => '1326169227','followup' => '0','packet' => '1','call' => '0','user_id' => '0'),

My name is Tony Ciampa and I\\\'m a Northeastern University student working on an online dating site called firstsighter in a venture accelerator.  Right now I have a budget of $11,000.  I\\\'m 110% aware that websites take far more then this to build.  My goal with this budget is to get enough functionality so when I\\\'m pitching to investors later this spring, I have progress I can display and let them play around with.

Quick overview of firstsighter so you know what the project entails (and yes, it\\\'s starting from scratch development wise):

See the first few brief slides of this pitch deck to get a feel for what our site will eventually do: http://www.slideshare.net/ciampaa/firstsighter-pitchdeck

And here\\\'s the wireframes that show more of what our minimum viable product will do (the MVP is essentially 7 different pages if you count signup application that I have spread out as one page): https://docs.google.com/a/husky.neu.edu/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B0upxS25FZ-lNTQzNWYwMDItN2JkNy00ZjdjLThmOWYtMTkzMDI4MTE1YWNk&hl=en_US

firstsighter will have the basic functions other dating sites have including a profile, a search function, and an inbox of sorts.  Our MVP won\\\'t require a matching function, that\\\'s something I would add later on down the road.

The differentiators of our MVP are twofold.  First, all users are ranked by other users in the same way they are on HotOrNot, except on our site all of these rankings are hidden (you can\\\'t ever know your rank or anybody elses rank).  Second, these hidden rankings are applied to every search and you can always only see people within one point of your rank (on a ten point scale).  

Look forward to talking more.  

Thanks!

Tony

At the initial onset, we will focus primarily on Vietnam as the only developing country that will be connected with members from developed countries such as the United States, England, India, Singapore, etcâ€¦ We also expect to expand very quickly with potentially millions of users.
Teachtoi provides our users a unique platform to teach, share and learn from one another through direct interactions via instant messaging, user profiles, forums, voice and video chat video and also through a user generated video database on topics ranging from language to business to art and live streaming video lectures hosted by experts in their respective fields. 
We essentially want a youtube like video hosting structure supplemented with a facebook user profile like features and a live video streaming function similar to ustream or justin.tv. 
Each member will have his/her own user profile similar to facebookâ€™s layout prior to the change to the current timeline layout. On the profile users will be able to post pictures, videos, information and also have some type of â€œwallâ€ where other members can post. There must be instant messaging chat capabilities and private messages between users. Further, we would also want some type of video/voice chat function that allows users to interact with one another while online. We understand that language may be an issue and therefore there must be some type of program/function that allows for instant translation for posting, private message, chatting etcâ€¦ Also if possible we would like to develop a program that takes audio and transcribes it and then translates it. For example if two people are chatting through the video/voice chat capabilities, what one person says can be transcribe into text and then from there translated into the other personâ€™s language. We donâ€™t know how feasible this is so this is optional, however a program to translate text immediately without having to go to google is a must. 
Each member must also have the ability to post a video up to at least 30 mins in length which will be collected in database with a search function. We want something similar to youtube in this regard. In addition some type of caption/subtitles function must be available where other members or our staff will be able to add subtitles.
Finally, we want to give each member the ability to live stream video and have other members be able to watch it live and send text which the person hosting the video will be able to receive and see. The live stream video will then be stored in the database if the person chooses to do so.
Essentially, the website will have initial register page in which people can log on through an email or a facebook login; a home page which will have a list of featured video along with a link leading to the video database, featured profiles/people with a link to a search function where people can search for members based on a certain criteria such as age, location, interest, gender, etcâ€¦ and finally a news feed that will show the activities of members; a user profile page as mentioned above.

I was interested in getting an estimate and timeline for building an aesthetically pleasing, scalable and user-friendly custom dating site. Although it would be similar to the more popular dating sites (like now defunct Yahoo Personals, okcupid, match.com) in some respects, I have a custom feature or two in mind that would hopefully make it difficult for potential competitors to duplicate my efforts. I\\\'ve explored a few affordable off-the-shelf components that have most of the features I desire in the site as far as functionality, however the design is pretty awful and they don\\\'t seem to offer much flexibility in terms of modifying an existing product and scalability.
Typical features include:â€¨â€¨
compatibility matching and detailed searches by preferences, keyword and username â€¨
the ability for profiles to be automatically screened for profanity, graphic content and personally identifiable information before being approved for viewing on theâ€¨siteâ€¨
some type of word or number verification when messages are sent to prevent abuse/spamâ€¨
verification of a valid email address before potential members have access to the siteâ€¨
a format where affiliate advertising/AdSense display can be easily integrated, as this is how I intend to monetize the site
Most importantly, I\\\'d like a content management system where the site can be easily maintained by one person, like www.plentyoffish.com  (Although the design is terrible, it is one of the largest and most successful dating sites, yet it has been run without employees for about 8 years, thanks to automated processes.)â€¨â€¨
Members should also have the option to:â€¨
receive potential matches sent to their personal email inboxes based on how often they chooseâ€¨
receive notification of new messages sent to their personal email addressâ€¨
decide whether or not to make their profiles searchableâ€¨
flag someone for site abuse (which will be brought to the admin\\\'s attention)
block another member
add favorites
Instant message (video would be great, but is not necessary) each other when online, with the ability to change their IM preferences and see the person\\\'s profile before accepting an invitation
have their email address or password info sent to them if forgotten 
I\\\'d also like to know whether you factor in search engine optimization, as well as what security measures would be necessary to prevent hacking/protect usersâ€™â€¨information. 
Sorry for the lengthy message, but I wanted to supply you with enough details to provide an accurate quote. Thank you for your time and consideration and I hope to hear from you soon!

We are looking for a \\"bigger\\" development house to take over where he left off if possible, as we were hoping to have this app launched by Feb 1 and are now way past our deadline.

To give you some background about what we are doing, we are a fast growing frozen yogurt chain that is developing an app to grow our social footprint. I\\\'ll try to explain as briefly as possible, though it is kind of complicated. If this doesn\\\'t make much sense I apologize, I\\\'m just trying to give you a feel for what is involved with this so that you can give us a better idea of time and cost. :-)

1) The app\\\'s main purpose is to allow check ins (Fbook, Twitter, Foursquare, etc.) for a discount. Basically what happens is a person checks in, the app pulls a \\"word of the day\\" from the database on our server, and displays the word on the screen to be shown or otherwise told to the cashier. This gets the person a free ounce of frozen yogurt (or whatever the deal maybe), and we get our name pushed to someone\\\'s social stream. This \\"word of the day\\" can be updated from our backend and changed when needed.

2) Seeing as not everyone has a smartphone, we have a few iPad kiosks set up per store to allow social check ins. Originally we were going to have the employees behind the counter verify the public check ins but it\\\'s really not feasible when it gets busy. We thought that having a secret word would allow checking in to be done separate from the validation, and remove the need to have someone checking the iPads.

3) In addition, the person running the app is able to select franchises/stores nearby to get updates from. For Apple it would be via APNS, not sure how to handle push notifications on Android. These updates contain information like flavor updates, discounts, stores opening nearby, etc. and again are selectively sent to the person based on their franchise preferences. It would be great to have the updates shareable as well, though that might get complicated. (e.g. you get an update that says \\"We are now opening a new franchise in Ocean City, NJ!\\" and people nearby can share that with their friends.)

4) Last but not least -- and I think this one is the real kicker -- we\\\'d like to have a \\"game plugin\\" system where we can put games in the app. Nothing major, but we\\\'d like to compete with Amy\\\'s Froyo at the very least. Not sure how easy \\"games inside apps\\" are, or if it would be better just to make a completely separate game app for the games. 

Ideally we wanted some kind of interface where the person is in one of our stores and has the ability to choose different items to accomplish different tasks. They might touch the iPad on the counter to check the updates or do a social check in, they might click the job board to open our job posting page in a webview or something, maybe there is an arcade game in the corner where they open the games, etc. This is all time consuming I know, and we are way behind schedule at this point, so any advice on how to realistically approach this would be appreciated.

Social pushing is #1 priority with this. Game high scores, incoming news updates, everything needs to be shareable.

What we have:
- An almost-complete back-end hosted on our server and built with Code Ignitor + Doctrine (already has tables built, the ability to push updates via APNS, etc.)
- Graphics

What we don\\\'t have:
- Obj-c/cocoa stuff for the app itself (unless somehow we are able to get what he has done so far from our Apple dev account?) -- This is going to be the hard part I think. We will need to start over from scratch with the app part.

So at this point, I am basically submitting a request to see how quickly your design house would be able to finish a project of this size, and at what cost.

 I know this email is probably confusing, so if you have any questions you can reach me at 239-297-5317 (or via email at kane@yogofactory.com).

Thanks for your time!

I wanted to get a proposal from your team on converting our phonegap/html-5 player into native iTunes/Droid apps that have music storage capabilities (for offline use).  The player/functionality won\\\'t need to change, we just want the native app for offline music file storage/play capability.

Please let me know who I can follow-up with in more detail to get a quote from you guys.  One of the unique requirements will be the ability to quickly and easily reproduce the native app for additional artists, so really want to produce a replicable process for growth.

Glad to see your business is growing and evolving and hoping we can work together again on this project or another.

The IRCT is a global network of 145 rehabilitation centres in more than 70 countries around the world; the global reach of the organisation and the vast skills pool of the network represent a large potential for knowledge sharing; however, the IRCT has no means to cheaply and effectively access and share this knowledge. The present memberâ€™s website is the tool better positioned to support that task, but it lacks complex interactive capabilities to do so.

Concept development

Member profile: Each member and the Secretariat would be given control of a profile page containing the organisationâ€™s basic information (i.e. name, address, contact details, services offered, key people, etc) and official logo.

Groups: Members would also have the possibility to group according to regions, regional networks, projects, campaigns, etc.

Social: Changes made to each profile and status updates would be visible to the whole network in a main page (updates feed), unless the organisation chooses to share a specific piece of information with a specific set of organisations / groups only.

Status of the network: All basic information inputted by each member in their profile pages would be automatically and instantly compiled and displayed in a â€œstatusâ€ page, offering at any time an overview of the network: a map would gather all locations, a graph would quickly display the range of services offered across the network, and so on.

Reporting / Statistics on torture: Members would also use their profile page to input key statistical data (e.g. number of clients treated in a given month, gender, age groups, etc) offering the possibility to anyone in the network to access at any time global statistics on torture.

My team has identified you as the company we would like to work with based on extensive online research.  We are trying to determine the best way to go about getting a comprehensive quote from your company.  We would like to put together a social networking website that will combine four concepts into one.  The first would be a facebook-style network, allowing people to have their individual pages, videos, pics, connections, \\"Like\\"-type buttons, privacy settings, etc.  The second concept would be a blog area, similar to WordPress, allowing people to read blogs, write blogs, and follow blogs.  The third concept would be a games section, similar to MomCafe.com, where people could come and compete in games or play solo.  The fourth concept would be that I would like a system where the users of the site could be rewarded for activity on the site (e.g.  Get points for uploading pics, playing games, sharing blogs, etc).  This rewards system would have to have a ranking system similar to EmpireAve.com.

Originally, the website would only need to be set up to handle 50,000 users, but I would want it to be quickly scaleable in the event that the site\\\'s popularity catches on.  While I am sure it is hard to nail down a price based on the information I have provided, I would love some guidance as to the cost range for a venture like this.  My team is getting very serious about the idea and we are working on our funding options at the moment, so a budget would go a long way towards making this a reality.  Please let me know if you need more information to help you come up with a reasonable range for our project.  Thanks so much!

At this stage, I want the site to be as basic and simple, yet as professional as possible; I would like this site to be a starting point which can be built upon.

As far as a price quote, I would prefer it to be between $10-15 Thousand, keeping it, at this stage, as basic as possible.

The design should be modern and sleek , not too much clutter. Its needs to be fully functional and smooth in its operation. Our open date is May 5th 2012 we would need love to have it up by then but understand that it may not be possible so time is flexible in that manner. 

Also let me know if you do regular maintenance or upkeep for the sites and what are your service fees for such things. 

Thank you looking forward to hearing from you. 

for reference check irokotv.com we would love to have a similar style with some important signature changes that are exclusive to HOPE TV.

I am desperately looking for a angel investor to make this app, since i do not have the skills nor money to make or create this myself. I know time is money and we are in desperate times so everybody is really edgy as to where and in what they invest anything from time to money. 

Being aware of this i still stand with all confidence that my concept will surpass facebook, twitter and cnn and all other information rendering website and app on the market and in the world. 

I am a simple student, looking for the right people to help, and share any future royalty or rewards from this 200% guaranteed app or website to give the 2-3-4 billion that use the internet per day around the world to have their own Cnn if you will to be therefore independent of any other place that renders the information that they would usually spend hours and open up to 2-3-7-8 tabs in a browser or have 4-5-6 apps on their smartphone to search or receive the news they are interested in. 

This can change, we can give everyone the power to filter information, and i know how to this, please, i ask one chance on opportunity. I will not disappoint you. 

I sincerely hope to receive a response from you as soon as possible.

Right now I\\\'m just price shopping. The site I would like to have created will be something like goodreads.com. I have a good idea but I might be getting in over my head, so for now I\\\'m putting together a business plan, and looking for the right person to work with.

Basically, I want a social network cataloging site that will do much the same things as goodreads.com , librarything.com, and shelfari.com. the list goes on, i have my own ideas, but I want to give you an idea of how much programming will be invalved with this. The site will mainly target ages from 12 - 35 year olds. I know that\\\'s not very specific, but I need a design that will stand out to young adults, but be easy enough on the eyes for someone who is in their late 30\\\'s or even 40\\\'s. 

Also, this is sort of going to be an \\\'add as you grow\\\' thing for me. So, I won\\\'t need to have a site that rivals the other sites yet. I\\\'ll probably tell you what the site must have in order to get up and running, and then work from there. Please let me know what I should expect to pay for a fully completed site like the three sites I mentioned above. This will give me an idea of how much the project will cost to completion.

Thanks for your time,

Similar version of the game: http://carboncopygames.com/games/index.php/acroblast/#.Tz62m7JCqaQ


Found the old site and rules at way back machine

â€¢	Enable users to save their preferences of the different types of bars/restaurants/areas of town that friends can see;
â€¢	Allow friends to message each other;

http://userlogos.org/files/logos/euphonicnight/UCIalt.png
The top would have EverythingUCI.com with a catch phrase underneath such as: where UCI students hang out\\"
Above the logo would be four buttons that lead to a different website still (but still part of the main) those are: UCI featured, Classifieds, Deals, Forums.
The website should somehow be able to integrate facebook and twitter.
colors may be inspired from : http://www.uci.edu/
Audience: College students at UCI 18-25 approx
Location: Irvine, California 92617
Education: College education

Must be be nice, flashy, modern, new-age, hip ---> Attractive to audience.

I am looking to create a political social network/donation portal. There will be four groups of users: Political Candidates, Political Parties, Political Action Committees, and the General Public.

Political Candidates will be able to create a profile based on the office they are running for. This profile will allow them to:
Upload Logos, Photos, Videos, etc.
Post Views, Blog, Information, Endorsements, Jobs, etc.

Link to outside sites
Most Importantly: Accept Campaign Donations

Other Possible features I would like would be the ability to:
Send Messages to followers
Send Emails to followers
Push information to other Social Networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

Political Parties
Political Parties will be able to create a profile based on their Party. This Profile will allow them to:
Upload Logos, Photos, Videos, etc.
Post Views, Blog, Information, Endorsements, Jobs, etc.
Link to other Party Levels (National, State, Local), Other Candidates, Party Members, etc.
Link to outside sites
Most Importantly: Accept Political Donations

Other Possible features I would like would be the ability to:
Send Messages to followers

General Public
The General Public will be able to create a profile to search for, interact with, follow, and donate to those candidates, parties, and PACs.

User Profile:
Users will begin by creating their profile with the required information:
Name
Address

This profile will also allow them to
Upload Logos, Photos, Videos, etc.

Follow Parties, Candidates, PACs,  etc.
Link to outside sites	
Most Importantly: Give Political Donations

Search:
Users will be able to search for Candidates, PACs, and Parties three ways:

Address/Voter eligibility: Based on the userâ€™s address they can search for every election they are eligible to vote for from their local government to the national. These races will list the candidates that are running with links to their profiles.

Views: Based on the userâ€™s views they will be able to search for candidates, parties, and PACs that have similar views regardless of where they are located.

Specific Race: Userâ€™s will be able to locate a specific race regardless of the level; everything from the Alderman in the 44th ward in their city to the President of the United States.

I am from the Government Services Insurance System or GSIS of the Philippines.

I came across your company and would like to inquire if you can provide me a ballpark figure on an application that would be for our IT Services Group utilization.  This is intended for all our kiosks spread around the nation (we have around 700 kiosks).

Initially we are looking at these functionalities:


1) Search functionality for our kiosks
2) location services (GPS) of our kiosks
3) end and start date of kiosks deployment
4) appointment setting for our IT field personnel

We are still gathering info to make our initial RFI but the gist would be something that our team may use to see the kiosks current status.

Thank you.

Cheers!

Users seeking help to achieve a goal create a goalask - a statement of a desired goal and a request for help to achieve the goal; hence â€œgoalâ€ and â€œaskâ€.  Users can also post a 30 second video of their goalask as well.  The goalask is published to the site where the user can invite friends and/or the world to participate.  

Responses to the goalask are presented to the user in a comment format with image captures from web resources recommended in the response.  Users manage responses by choosing the ones that best meet their needs.  

From the responses chosen, users create a vision board, a mosaic of website image captures with embedded links tailored to assist them in achieving their desired goal.  The embedded links reference websites, blogs, applications, videos, software, books and/or other services.

+Brand Talent +Coupons, +FeedShare, +Past Memories, +Mother Talk). The Website  look and feel should be unique and not in violation of any copyrights.

The code must be documentationed and understood by our programmer and by your colleagues in case of future enhancement of functionalities. The code should be modular and well-organized and should not contain any encrypted files. 

Let us know how long it takes to complete it perfectly. No saving time on bad and unintelligible code. I assume the work will be completed within a 45 days window.

Only those who can meet serious deadline and agree to our terms shall engage.

All software must be self contained and no outside services should be required. This project must not rely on any services that require monthly (or other) fees for live video chat or other services. No outside services. No other software to buy. 
I require complete and fully-functional working program(s) in executable form as well as complete source code of all work done (so that I may modify it in the future). A backup copy of all deliverables is to be sent electronically by way of upload to the final server used for installation AND zipped file should be sent via email.

All rights to this software belong exclusively to me  and you will provide 100% of the source code upon completion.

We expect developers  to be available during the programming by USA/Canada telephone and email. You should be able to communicate well in English.

We would also be interested in mid to long-term support and further development with your company. 

I will pay you by escrow after completion, upload and debug. Escrow will be released to you when the full website is complete, debugged, and uploaded to my server to my satisfaction.

Installation guideline:
â€¢	Prototype: The analyst will create a non-working mockup of all pages/screens in the final software. Creating a prototype makes it easier for the user to visualize the final software, and reduces misunderstandings.
â€¢	Requirements Document: The analyst will create a document describing everything the final software will do (other than what is documented in the prototype...if the employer required one).
â€¢	Any website server-side deliverables must be installed by the developer company will move the software from the place it was created ( QC environment) to where you will use it (production environment) in ready-to-run condition in the Buyer\\\'s environment.
â€¢	The installer then tests the software to make sure that the installation was done properly and completely.

So, CB would also enhance networking between professionals and companies.

I would also like CB to function also a social networking integration (SNI) tool for business.  I would like a â€˜SNI Tickerâ€™ at the bottom of the site; that allows members to see what their customers are saying on the various social networking sites.  Then they could also use the SNI ticker to update the various social networking sites.  Plus, I would like for each company to be able to create a public profile for their customers.  So, companies would give their customers an easy and fun way to post comments, pictures and or upload videos of how much they enjoy (or detest) their products.  

Finally, CB members should also be able to sell products and have a â€˜white boardâ€™ to post various announcements (I.e. upcoming sales, events, and or job opportunities). There should also be a dashboard, where CB members can build in metrics and other organizational goals.

Where are all of the pictures I sent you? You have really played me on this one, and I am upset with the small amount of data that you sent me on disc.

I am looking to launch a social networking website predominately geared towards high school student athletes.  As a small business start-up, Classlete seeks to be the premiere Social Media platform for high school student athletes, combining the genres of sports, fitness/health, community and education, all centered around the â€œlife of a student athleteâ€.  Because I am based here in Toronto, Canada, the website will focus on Canadian content but would incorporate the US as it grows.

It is a destination for high school students or student athletes to create/share their profiles discuss and support their school\\\'s team and players (blogs, forums, polls, and pics/videos), allowing users to engage in content that is educational and community driven while bridging this audience with businesses through a digital magazine exclusive to profile users on our site.

The site needs to be SEO friendly, mobile friendly (smartphone and tablet), a visually engaging for an average 13-18 year old teen.  I have a few ideas visually and functionally on how I want to site to look and function particularly for the Home Page and Profile Pages, but would be open to your ideas.  

I am open to using Wordpress/Buddypress, another social networking platform like phpFox (http://www.phpfox.com/features/) or having something custom built - whatever is the most cost-effective but results in the best looking and functional website.

Here is a list of features from phpFox that I would like to integrate.  See this link for reference on the features (http://www.phpfox.com/features/): 

Needs:
-Mobile friendly on any smartphone or tablet
-Content Management System (CME) â€“ I think I will need this since I want to have control over the website and what users/viewers can access.  May need further clarification on this though.
-User Groups â€“ I think I need this for the 2 initial profile users (Fan vs Athlete).  I may entertain a 3rd profile for those that are â€œBloggers/Contributorsâ€ to the site.
-Attachments â€“ just to enable users to upload their photo
-Private Message
-Administration
-Videos
-Social Sharing
-Activity Feed
-Ajax Browsing
-Ad Campaigns
-Photos
-Friends
-Custom Fields
-Members Profile â€“ this feature seems to include a lot of the above needs already

Wants:
-Instant Messenger
-Monetize
-Blogs â€“ Initially, the idea was to have up to 5 independent bloggers partner with our site to contribute content centered around â€œthe life of a student athleteâ€, but this feature interests me since I can allow the users to blog.  But is template agreement that I could use between Classlete and the blogger stating that Classlete would own the content once they publish to the website?
-Forums
-Subscriptions â€“ This would be way in the future but would consider long term especially for the magazine functionality
-Forums
-Extensibility â€“ donâ€™t totally understand this but it sounds like I will need this.  I may need your help in better understanding this.
-Polls


Launch of the site needs to be live after testing by August 1st 2012 coinciding with most high schools opening in September 2012.

Give me a shout to further discuss this opportunity and hopefully understand whether or not the overall costs will fit into my budget.

Looking forward to your response guys.


Thanks,


Chris James

I hope this email finds you well as I have an idea for an internet startup. It\\\'s a social network for musicians, venues, and fans. One site, called ReverbNation, does this already, but they do a pretty poor job and lack many of the features I have in store for mine. This would be a site where bands can share their music, book venues, find band members, have fans hear their music, have venues book them, share their music, do their own promotion, and more. Basically, anything that a label could do, the band could do themselves, but for a significantly lower cost than with a label. CDs aren\\\'t selling as well as they used to, more musicians are being found online, and many bands are choosing not to be signed because they can self-manage without being undercut by labels. Musicians are so close to separating themselves from labels. All they need is a tool. This is that tool.


The current status of development has been an extended hiatus. I had one developer working for me, but the project didn\\\'t get very far during that period. I\\\'m looking for website designers and developers now. Your role would be building the site, writing the various proprietary programs for it, and making it look pretty.


QUALIFICATIONS:

    Be able to set and meet deadlines. I would like a launch date of mid-July, but that may be amenable depending on feasibility.
    TRANSPARENCY is very important. I need to know what you are working on from week-to-week and how it looks. Be able to take notes as you code so that if you decide to leave, it isn\\\'t too difficult for your replacement to resume your work.
    Have the skill to write programs that incorporate maps, draw data from user profiles, and access information from other sites.

If you meet all the qualifications and are interested in hearing more detail to provide an accurate estimate, please hit me up and I\\\'ll gladly elaborate after having you sign an NDA. Thank you for taking the time to read about and consider my project.

I\\\'m hoping you can help my company with their up and coming website. 

We would like to create a \\\'recruitment village\\\' whereby employers and jobseekers can log into their respective areas of the site and use recruitment services such as a job board, chat site where employers and candidates can connect, send virtual business cards and chat confidentially (currently being created and would just need a link to this site and i think would possibly need some tweaks to the way that the data and log on is managed), community notice board, guest bloggers, and directory of companies within a chosen industry.

If the project is successful, the aim is to create seperate villages with the same services for different recruitment industries.

We would like the look and feel of the website to be similar to a horizontal website, so that users can feel as though they are walking in \\\'straight line\\\' in a village looking at different store fronts. When they get to the service they would like to use, they can click on the store door and be redirected to that service.

Users will pay a monthly or annually subscription and once payment is received they will be issued a log on name and password to enter the site. When logged in employers will have the power to upload new jobs, add their company to the directory etc and jobseekers will be able to register for job alerts, view the job board and directory etc. Payment gateway option is negotiable depending on price as this could also be done manually. Eg they fill out all their details in a form, we receive this and give them a telephone call to confirm and take payment and then issue them with their log on details.

We are a UK based company, so I understand that it is impossible for us to meet to discuss, but would welcome any help/quotations you could supply. If you have any similiar works, I would also be interested in viewing. 

I hope this all makes sense.

Many thanks,

Brooke Jacobsen

The purpose of the site is to provide a platform for like minded people to engage in conversation and give their pets a voice. Our research shows that already 10% of pets in North America already have their own profile on line. Our site will allow the main profile to be set up for the pet and then connected to a companion or Companions (owners) profile. We will allow members to connect with their brothers and sisters or with others that are from the same breeder. 
The goal of the site is to build a large meebrship by providing a great experience and relevant information. In our business model we see revenue coming from our ability to generate very targeted advertising (IE Dog Groomer in Toronto can focus on dog owner in their geography). We have looked at the NING platform (with OpenX as the ad server) as a way to create and start the site, but find it somewhat limiting relative to the features we would like to offer. We have the creative work done and the site mapped out. I am wondering what you might have that will allow is to provide the user experience we want without breaking the bank.

You were the last (#10) listing on Page 1 - I need to build a Mobile Social Network for a Mobile Lifestyle Club. The dot.com domain will carry ONLY a very brief overview of what the club is about. The social network would be built as a mobile WEB app/site (as opposed to a native app), because:

1) I need to charge for membership without paying Apple 30%

2) I need to charge for different levels of membership at prices which would seem high if I were to apply them to an app for purchase

3) I need to make certain sections/content of the social network accessible only to members with the requisite level of membership, thereby encoring members to continually upgrade their membership level to access more valuable content.

4) I need to integrate an Affiliate Program to drive member referrals/product sales and as far as I know, tracking affiliate links is not possible in an iOS app, (although I don\\\'t mind being the first person to make it happen)

5) I want to create an \\"exclusive air\\" to the club and do not want to have the club publicized to \\"all and sundry\\" via search engines. If there was a way to prevent a website, mobile or otherwise, from ever showing up in the search engines, i\\\'d want to do that. That may sound like the most ridiculous thing you\\\'ve ever heard, not wanting to be found in the search engines, but I\\\'m a seasoned marketing professional and I know exactly what I\\\'m doing in that department. What I\\\'m not, however, is a \\"true\\" mobile developer. I have developed one mobile app myself which is now on the App Store, but that was built without coding via one of those DIY platforms. Hence, for something this specialized, I\\\'m now deferring to true mobile developers.

That said, I only want to make membership available to iPhone Owners, so it would SEEM that the easiest way to do that would naturally be to facilitate member signup exclusively through an iPhone NATIVE app  - a Free app download, but requiring in-app payment to activate membership and unlock access to whatever areas of the app coincide with the level of membership chosen.

I want ALL aspects of the social network to be accessible on the iPhone, especially the videos, which seems to be a major missing piece of the puzzle for social networking platforms like Ning and SocialGo etc. Even though I found a \\"somewhat social\\" platform that facilitates mobile video on iPhone, it does not display a mobile-optimized version of the site on the iPhone. I simply cannot afford to deliver anything less than a first class user experience to my members and prospective members. The platform I used to build my first app, a mobile destination guide, while it does accommodate video playback on the phone, it does not facilitate in-app payments and can only lock audio, video and image files.

It\\\'s been quite a frustrating time for me trying to find a pre-existing social networking platform that would allow me to get such a MOBILE social network up and running very quickly and at very minimal cost. I have come to the conclusion that I may have to go the custom development route instead and be prepared to spend quite a bit more to get up and running than I had originally hoped.

Ultimately, however, I am really interested in hearing what your experts believe is the best approach, mobile WEB app or NATIVE app, given the special considerations/intent I\\\'ve listed above, and what you are able to do for me to make my vision a reality in the shortest possible time.

Image based social networking site
Main Concept: Share, see and comment on images

Users can do the following:

Upload Images:
Posting Images: Each image will have description, tags, ask questions (with poll as an option), get comments, edit images (API to 3rd party sites for image editing), share at other social sites etc.  Multiple images can be posted in a single post. 
Images can be posted via their computer, mobile app or via bookmarks. 
Tag images â€“ by clicking on the image and writing the description. This way when the mouse moves over the image, the tagged elements show up. An image can have multiple tags. 

View images: 
By different criteria: Top liked, New, search by categories (multiple attributes). Users can zoom into an image, slide show, like it, share it at other social sites, comment on it, answer to polls/questions. 

Shop â€“ there will be a catalog feed from affiliates that will be shown on this section. Products will be organized by categories (multiple attributes). The site will not have itâ€™s own fulfillment (payment etc). This will be a storefront for products from the affiliates. 

Site Main Sections:
Top Liked Images
New Images
Post New Images
Shop
User profile

This site will contain all the social networking features
Each user will have itâ€™s own url (site name/username) that will show their profile, description about them, blog urls, their likes, their uploads (categorized)
Profile Management and settings
Back end reporting and community management
Each user will get a badge based on their participation. 
A widget where users can cross link this site to their own sites

Mobile app for iPhone/iPad and Android

Without any more delays, here are the features I want:

A social networking platform that allows users to:
Register/Login
Upload photos
Create a profile
Send messages
Share and invite friends
Browse users, and wishes
A wishlist system, combined with the social networking platform with which users will be able to:
Add items they find on the site to their wish lists
Share those wish lists with their friends through the site, emails, facebook, and various social networks.
Get notified when their friends add new items to their wish lists.
Get notified when someone buys them an item from their wish list.
Get alerted when someone\\\'s birthday, anniversary, or celebration is approaching so that they can in turn buy them gifts. (Each user will set the specific dates and events they celebrate along with the corresponding presents. We don\\\'t want someone to send Christmas gifts to a Jewish friend lol)
An e-commerce platform that does the following:
Let users browse the selection of products available through the site.
Calculate and add shipping costs to the orders.
Automatically calculate and subtract the company\\\'s commission from the purchase price. (optional)
Allow users to share the purchase of an item through \\"Group Buying\\" where one user pays part of the purchase price and shares the responsibility, rewards, and expense with another user.
A rewards/points system that:
Assigns a predetermined point value to each item in the store.
Keeps track of the points earned by each user.
Rewards each user for any action with the determined amount of points for taking such an action.
Subtracts the correct number of points from a user\\\'s account when he/she uses those points towards a discount on an item instead of paying full price.
Calculates the right amount of points to deduct from a user\\\'s account when that user decides to simply redeem his/her points in the form of a product, or a service.
An ad monetization system that allows the company to:
Earn CPC and CPM revenue from ads.
Convert the cost of advertising into points that may have been earned by a user/company.

My husband and I own and operate FitnessBlender.com. We have experienced enough growth that we are currently looking to potentially move to a web developing company that can keep up with our need to expand. We have a number of different projects that we are looking to do - both large expansions & moderate modifications to current pages.

Right now, we are looking to drastically step up the prevalence of ads on all of our web pages. In the very near future we are hoping to develop a \\"Members\\" side that allows users to develop custom weekly/monthly schedules using our workout videos.

I know this is a vague description of our plans but I am hoping to open a dialogue with your company about expenses, & what you are capable of & whether or not it may work for our companies needs.

I look forward to talking with you,

1. Create a profile and customize an avatar to identify their account, list interest, bio.

2. Set privacy settings (i.e. private {allowing other users on the site with profiles to view videos} and public {allowing all the general public to view the videos}.

3. Upload original videos.

4. Basic links below videos to share videos (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, other social networks)

5. Have a maximum amount of video files sizes that can be uploaded.

6. Upon setting up their account they would need to link their PayPal or Bank account information and be able to get paid once a month, from the website.

7. User is able to see how many views they are getting on their videos (total views and specific video views).

If you check, your competitorsâ€˜www.webscribble.com,www.rsitez.com,www.megastarmedia.com\\\' are there on the first page and they

My name is Jason and i am doing Internet marketing from past 4 years. I can bring your website pearsestreet.com on main page

1) social network software
2) best social networking software
3) social networks software
4) top social networking software
5) free social networking software



I am sure this will get you more business through internet. Also, organic SEO can save your money, if you are investing huge

All users will set up groups that will \\"host\\" the events that they choose. Suggested  event topics will be listed within their group discussion boards (solos, music genres, comedy stand up etc.  Anyone can host an audio competition for free but if they choose to create a paid event, they will have to deposit a set price of $5. They will then recruit members in order to reach their required milestone of at least $1000 (200 members $5 each) in order to start accepting submissions ($8 each). The maximum cash prize will be $10,000 per event with a maximum submission acceptance of 2000 per event. Since $8x2000=$16000, the remaining $6000 will be split up between all group members which is a total of $30 each. This allows the group to give away $10,000 to the person with the most liked audio file (within a 30 day period) and increase their initial investment 6 times. These funds can be used to make submissions to other events or deposited into their paypal accounts. Facelesstar will not take any funds from any  subscriber at any time. My vision is to create a place where people can help others by investing a little,getting back a little more, and possibly taking home allot. In order for this to work in my opinion I would have to display all activities concerning contributions within the web pages in real time. I also wan\\\'t the groups who host the events to review their submissions prior to launching and displaying available slots publicly as well as a countdown clock. In addition, all member of facelesstar will be anonymous. People will be able to communicate with who ever they choose, make as many submissions and join or create as many groups as they like (some will be paid of course.)The main rules to compete is no promoting or advertising anything, revealing your identity, attempting to collect royalties, using copyrighted material they do not own.  Being anonymous allows the people who may not be as confident as others to let it out and sing, try their new stand up routine, podcast,etc. It also allows those who have great talent to win allot of money. Those who do win will not only have cash but they will be allowed to create custom profiles where they can promote anything they wish and their identities will be revealed in our news feed if they wish.  I also have a radio website that will play commercial music that I want to be accessible to all members at any time within the social networking site. My future goal is for the social network to make the radio website popular enough that I can begin to broadcast the top amateur musicians over the web in order to compete for a sponsored recording contract. At the moment I have the radio site design completed (no content) and I am trying to build the social networking website via a hosted website builder but I not sure how much content can be added. I really need some guidance on a best business strategy and an accurate quote on what all of this would cost me from the point of progress that I am. Sorry this was so long.

Let us create a system that serves as a translation engine across multiple platforms; allow users to seamlessly interact with their Friends using the front end of their choice.

Users will create a profile and securely provide their Social Network / Mobile # / E-Mail / etc information to the engine, along with a preferred method of communication. The engine will serve as an intermediary, translating incoming messages from the sender\\\'s format to the preferred platform and vice versa for replies.

Example:
//

John prefers texting and doesn\\\'t check his Facebook inbox often.
Jane prefers Facebook messages but doesn\\\'t always have access to her mobile phone.

- Jane sends a Facebook message to John\\\'s Facebook: \\"Hey what\\\'s for dinner?\\"

*** The translation engine receives the Facebook message on John\\\'s behalf and converts it to a text message.

- John receives a text message on his mobile phone from \\"Jane\\": \\"Hey what\\\'s for dinner?\\"
- John replies to the text he received, \\"I\\\'ll pick up a pizza on the way home for us.\\"

*** The translation engine receives the text from John on Jane\\\'s behalf and converts it to a Facebook message.

- Jane receives a Facebook message from John\\\'s profile that reads \\"I\\\'ll pick up a pizza on the way home for us.\\"
- Jane replies to the Facebook message from John \\"ok awesome!\\"

*** The translation engine receives the Facebook message on John\\\'s behalf and converts it to a text message.

- John receives a text from \\"Jane\\" \\"ok awesome!\\"
//

During this entire interaction Jane was simply communicating with John via Facebook.
John was only sending Jane \\"texts\\".

This engine will obviously rely on various social network APIs, a text message relay, email, etc. The underlying infrastructure should allow for future developments (methods of communication) to be \\"bolted-on\\" to the platform.

This project will include the design and construction of the underlying infrastructure, a website for users to register and enter their credentials, and ultimately the ability to translate and deliver across these methods of communication:

Text Messages & MMS
Facebook
LinkedIn
Email
gChat
AIM

The project also entails the creation and development of mobile applications for users that prefer delivery via mobile (iPhone & Android applications). The mobile applications should seamlessly bridge the methods of communication. e.g., texting should feel like a stand-alone texting app and emails should feel like a stand-alone email app. The goal is to become a universal method of communication.

Future add-ons and projects will be awarded!

The basic concept is twofold:  1. to help people find old flames or crushes (old high school sweethearts or people they had a crush on from the past but never got the nerve to ask out).    2. To help people connect with people they may have a crush on but are too shy to act in person or, in another scenario, to make it possible for strangers who make eye contact at a traffic stop or flirt on the subway on the way to work.  

The website I have in mind will have two sides: Old Flames and New Sparks, or something to that effect.  On each side, I would like to allow the user to either post their name or a keyword phrase that someone may search for them under.  On the old flames side, they would fill out a year, state, city, etc..  The site would need a keyword search feature.  If someone looks for them on the site they would need to be able to search and also would like a U.S. map with states clickable, down to cities, then show names and keyword phrases.  People who come to the site searching for that someone would use either the search feature or by clicking on the map (state, city, then year and search for names or keyword phrases) to find that someone from their past.

For the New Sparks side, where people will try to connect with that guy/girl they flirted with at the movie theatre or on the bus to work, they would also need to fill in a state, city, etc.. form, but not necessarily a year since this scenario would be recent. Maybe just have a field to fill in day of the week and month.  Scenario:  A guy and a girl, who don\\\'t know each other, flirt on the busride downtown in Chicago on their way to work on a Tuesday morning.  Neither is brave enough or has time to connect more before the ride ends.  They can\\\'t stop thinking about each other so we\\\'ll say the guy goes to this site, clicks on Illinois, then Chicago, then Tuesday of the appropriate date.  Since he never caught the girls name, he types in the phrase \\"We made eye contact on the 310 bus this morning.  I can\\\'t stop thinking about you.\\"   Or something to that effect.  The girl, knowing of this website through the intense marketing that will have to be done, goes to this site in hopes that the guy is looking for her.  She clicks Illinois, Chicago, etc..., and starts reading all the names or keyword phrases posted on that date and sees his message.  Boom!  Connection!  

Okay, so I\\\'m thinking that people find each other in this way.  To reply, they\\\'ll need to have a way to register and then come up with a unique username and password and then have a way to message each other in some sort of chat or private messaging through the site.  I\\\'m thinking about possibly having them pay a fee to reply but may not do that until I get a large database of users first.

My name is Patricia Bajis and I am a junior in high school. I am interested in making a social site that has the aspects of a social networking site, but it\\\'s not exactly one. It would have members and they would have a profile, but it would only contain one picture, a short bio and other information. I don\\\'t like to give too much information away because I am contacting various places about the site. My biggest barrier has been the technology aspect and I love all the work that you have done. I would be looking to make money off of it also. Sorry I am being very vague, it\\\'s hard to be specific, but not give much away. The closest thing to it would be LinkedIn as people can view your profile, and you have it there for that purpose. Unfortunately, I\\\'m only a junior and I\\\'m working with a tight budget so if there is any way to have a lower price when designing or something if I pursue business with you I would greatly appreciate it!

Thank you so much!

It would be a social network site with global interaction. I would like it to have a format maybe similar to craigs list but not exactly. It would encompass political happenings, food recepies from people around the world that anyone could tap for a dinner-breakfast-lunch idea, vacation ideas, advertising, essentially unlimited in networking ideas in as real time as possible. 
You would have maybe a continent you could click from the globe with the continent opening to a map of it on seperate page(s) with all the designated format information available for that specific part of the world. From the continent page (the mouse would highlight the country as you pointed to it and maybe have blog activity rank avail) you could click from the map the desired country to search or just type in the country from a search menu. Lets say one picked the politics catagory, you could then blog with the people of that country and get some perspective from the people of the reigion. Lets say you picked the hobbies blog page, and you picked Philately (stamp collecting) you could have discussions about the hobby - the ideas are endless.
The spinning globe or just globe would be the iconic brand logo. Yes, this is a lot to ask for, but I would like some input on the concept and realities for such a tall order.

And in turn be rated themselves. The reward being promotional codes and discounts from major clothing companies based on the amount of picture reviews performed and pictures they upload.
 
They would take a picture of themselves before going out, or if they were having a hard time picking an outfit to wear. The picture then goes into a database (along with all pictures uploaded from all members) and when another member goes to do reviews the most recently uploaded picture gets reviewed first. Making the ratings as instant as possible. For example, you try on two outfits, upload the pictures, go finish your make up and by the time you were finished youâ€™d have an anonymous rating on both telling you which one was preferred more. 

The rating system would be on a five star scale for all major articles of clothing including, shirt/ top, pants/shorts/bottoms, shoes, jewelry, etc. With a 120 character comment section. Also when uploading a photo there would be an option for â€œtaggingâ€ what each brand of the clothing is.

On each user profile you would have a gallery of your own pictures. With a subcategory for each type of outfit, for example; summer/fall/winter/spring, school, work, late night, gym, swim, etc. Each picture would accumulate their overall ranking from the anonymous rating system.

The communication between users directly would only consist of being able to â€œkeep an eyeâ€ on other fashionable peoples new uploaded pictures. For example, if female celebrities had profiles. Or close friends. 

The actual incentive of uploading a picture and rating others, like I mentioned, would come from the database of discounts/promotions from major clothing companies. You would unlock a specialized discount code to a selected company after a certain amount of picture uploads and picture ratings. For example 5 pictures uploaded and 15 picture ratings unlock 1 promotional code to an online store, of your choice, located on that stores site. Nothing is actually sold through us. We would just offer a real life view of what certain clothing looks like on womenâ€™s bodies. And in turn offer free consumer feedback to these companies that give promo codes exclusively to our site. When one of our members uses our exclusively provided code, we would receive a small commission for the total sale. (Exceptionally low in most cases around 5-10%) Weâ€™d handle getting the clothing companies on board but we would just need a place on the site that was secure (only accessible after the prerequisites of 5 picture uploads and 15 picture ratings were reached).  

Five main parts to site: 
1. profile
2. upload/ gallery area
3. rating area
4. user search area
5. clothing company/ promotional code/ discounts area

Thats it really. 	

This site would in a way combine three talking points for women; their closets, their thoughts on others fashion, and FREE DISCOUNTS. 

Our company is looking for:
1.	Simplicity
2.	Aesthetics
3.	User friendliness
4.	Easy pic uploads
5.	Easy profile management
6.	Easy navigation
7.	Ad space (very limited but still some)
Rules for site: 
â€¢	Minimum age of 16
â€¢	Female only
â€¢	No nudity
â€¢	No profanity in comments on anonymous ratings
â€¢	No sharing of promotional codes/discounts from clothing companies between users.

Project details:

 

1)sign-up with a existing facebook/twitter account.

2)When members sign up they can friend request other members, like facebook, or follow 

   members, like twitter. You are also presented with recommended interest groups for you to join.

3)When you join you can also search for groups of your interests.

4)The website administartor can use the site to make creating groups become an automated

process. All the admin. has to do is type in the name of a group and the website will find a 

picture you can use and  fill in the info. for the group.

5)You can network with other users in groups or by friend/follower relationship by interest by:posting 

status updates (links, videos, text, pics), webcam, IM. The interests will be as broad as sports or as 

specific as alabama Crimson Tide College Football.

My name is Wilson Greene and I am a managing partner of Nlyte Enterprises Inc. (nlyteu.com) and I am in the beginning stages of searching for a web development partner for our website.  We are looking for a partner who understands the social environment and who has the capabilities for very custom work.

The project will ultimately have 3 or 4 main components but the first component is really to launch a \\"music contest\\" using a lot of the same features that I see used with eshac.  A few caveats as we are strictly focused on the college market but similar concept.  What we\\\'d like for the initial launch is:

User profiles for fan/artist
Artists: will have profile page which includes: photos, bio, music player, total votes, etc.  Custom music player that displays total votes for day, week, all time. Will also have html code or ability to share their entry into the contest with all social networks.
Fans: will have basic profile page where they can vote x amount of times per day for their fav. artists etc., share fav artists with social networks, etc.

We would need home page to show top 10 artists and be able filter entries by university, genre.  We are officially launching in the fall of 2013 but this will be a test run for 2 spring break live events we are going to have for the winners.

There are obviously other details but you get the picture.  From this we will expand the site into a full blown college social network that ties in with our off-line events.

What I need is more info into \\"how customized\\" this can be, pricing, timeline.  We really need to launch this before the beginning of second semester.  We understand time wise, it will be pushing it very close but we are still in the process of getting funded, paperwork, more paperwork. yada yada yada.  Please feel free to contact me at any time.

The project is called MyVerse and it is intended to help kids not just create a cover for their self-written book but actually detail the interior complete with characters, synopsis and plot.

Here are the details:

MyVerse Notes
Phase One: Books
I.	Part One: Book Covers 
    a.	Be able to draw and/ or paint the cover on an app
    b.	Be able to breathe life into the cover and move objects with your hand.
    c.	Change colors of objects
    d.	Cost is free

II.	Part Two: Complete the work on the website
    a.	Have the student write the work on a Word template OR
    b.	Have a series of questions answered and guide them as to how to  finish the book.
 1.	Title of book
 2.	What\\\'s your book about? And define \\"synopsis\\"
 3.	Who are your characters? After each character, a prompt would then  appear and ask the student to answer questions as if they were that character. There is a limit of four characters.
 4.	Questions to be asked of each character (limit of four)
    a.	What is your name?
    b.	What do you look like?
    c.	What makes you happy?
    d.	What makes you sad?
    e.	What is your favorite food?
    f.	Where do you live?

c. After these questions have been answered then define â€œplotâ€ and ask the question: â€œWhat problem does the main character have and how will they overcome it?â€
d.	Then move chapter titles and outline. An outline of their story (complete with chapter numbers and headings) can pop up and move to the left of the screen as they write.
e.	As they write the chapter script reminders will appear about things to keep in mind as they write their story. Before the first chapter they will be asked to describe what kind of house their characters live in and what life is like. Before the 2nd chapter they will be asked what the main character\\\'s dilemma is or what they must overcome. Before the 3rd chapter they will be asked who will help them accomplish it. Before the 4th chapter they will be asked what stands in their way of accomplishing their goal and before the 5th chapter they will be asked how they resolve it. After proper editing, word doc is converted to PDF and is merged with cover.
f.	Option: We can have a simpler version for kids at first. It needs to be something that is not so overwhelming.
g.	Website should have advertising for all Leonardoverse books.
h.	Cost is free to the consumer.
i.	At this point, the PDF can be seen on the website which would have a comment section and have the characteristics of a social network.



III.	Part Three: Option to Sell 
    a.	Would charge minimal cost to take the work to the next step.
    b.	We would need to reach an agreement with Create Space and Kindle to possibly host the sales of each on MyVerse website. We want to keep them there.
    c.	Print: Create Space can print. We can upload for a fee or coordinate with CreateSpace for a portion of the proceeds which they get anyway. Create Space can assign a free ISBN once itâ€™s ready for print.
    d.	Digital: Sell on the MyVerse website or on Amazon Kindle. Kindle does not need an ISBN so we would need to make it available exclusively on one platform. 
    e.	Question: Can we give them the option of donating a portion of their sales to a school or club of their choice?

IV.	Part 3.5: Social Networking site
    a.	Create the website to be a social networking site where kids can show off their work to each other.

However, I\\\'d like to build a social network which includes membership settings, a dating module and facilities for users to search for clubs and events similar to ClubBuzz in your portfolio.

If possible, I would also like to integrate a 3D Chat Rooms Module similar to IMVU or 2nd Life. Does your team offer any facility for this type of creation? (Please include separately in the quote)

I know this is very limited information and with time I would be able to provide a clearer picture for your team to work with.

In the mean while, I\\\'d like to get an approximate quote for a job like this to include in my planning phases. Also, since it seems like prices start from 10,000 US and up, are there special payment methods (e.g. $1000/month for 12 months)?

Looking forward to your response. Thank you very much.

I thought you might like to know some of the reasons why you are not getting enough Social Media and Organic search engine traffic for Cti-Maine.com
  
1.Your website cti-maine.com is not ranking top in Google organic search for many competitive keyword phrases.
  
2. Your website profile is not available in most of the Social Media Websites.
  
3. Your site has 265 Google back links, this can be improved further.
  
There are many additional improvements that could be made to your website, and if you would like to learn about them, and are curious to know what our working together would involve, then I would be glad to provide you with a detailed analysis in the form of a WEBSITE AUDIT REPORT for FREE.
  
Our clients consistently tell us that their customers find them because they are at the top of the Google search rankings.  Being at the top left of Google (#1- #3 organic positions) is the best thing you can do for your company\\\'s website traffic and online reputation.
  
I found your site in the Google search and after having a look over your website I think you should go for an SEO campaign to boost your marketing strategy.
  
Sounds interesting? Feel free to email us or alternatively you can provide me with your phone number and the best time to call you.

All of the domains contain a word at the beginning that will be the umbrella brand, so basically what we need is an interactive online universe that connects each of the individual websites through a social media website. For example, if someone buys tickets from the ticket website or puts something up for bidding on the auction website, when they register they are also registering a profile through the social media website and peoples friends on our social media can see what they are selling in the marketplace or if they put there house up for sale via the real estate listings site and so forth. and all of the websites should allow for interaction through the social media website. Another example, if someone books plane tickets and a hotel room through our travel website, they should be able to post on our social media where they bought there tickets and if they bought tickets for a Broadway show they can also share this and the name of the show will link to out ticketing website where they bought it. A complete online universe with individual components under one brand but connected through a single social network.

My colleague and I are working on a project that is essentially a social network for music sharing. Weâ€™ve been working with an independent programmer for a few months who eventually just gave up on the project but made some significant progress in the project before doing so. The link to the project in progress can be seen here:
Gentleinfotech.com/jamcabin

What would the estimate be on a project involving a social network of musicians releasing their free music so that it can be downloaded by their fans, with the artists and fans all having independent social profiles where they can post music they release in the case of artists or music/artists they like in the case of fans?

Ideally, we\\\'d like to provide our patrons with the ability chat with one another and conduct their research using the tools available on the site. Our site must be member only with custom profiles for each patron which includes info such as occupation, education, investing experience and top holdings (for credibility reasons). Patrons should be able to tag/follow their favorite investor speculator. To further enhance site traffic, we would like to have tabbed a list of all AACSB business schools in the U.S. This serves not only as network enhancement but provides traffic to top business schools. Patrons with similar education backgrounds will be highlighted on their profile pages with the ability to instant message those online. Investment speculation is a very serious business and with the right tools and network ability, investors can substantially increase their profitability in the markets. Other important site components include:

I wish to create a Social Networking App like none other. 

I wish for it to connect friends/family/colleagues much like Facebook Events but in Real time.
Using the GPS available on the iPhone I wish for users to be able to do the following

- See how far and where about their friends are from an event (How many times have you called someone asking them where are they?)

- People invited to the event to see where the host is in real time (Say they are moving if they are doing a pub crawl or gone out of the house for a few minutes)

-Get an ETA on how far their friends might be

-App gives best directions to the event for the use

I believe this could spearhead a new wave of networking and am interested in developing this idea with the right team.

The site design will be rather complex because of the multiple concepts that I would like to incorporate. I want to create a site where fashionistas, designers, photographers, makeup and hair artists, fashion writers and reporters, and textile designers can all come together to share thier \\"passion for fashion\\". I want to have an area of the website dedicated to free profiles for the fashion forward individuals that would like to have a place where they share ideas, designs, portfolios, and blog about the latest trends and events. I also want to incorporate pinboards to thier profiles and would like to have it so that they can create networks of friends that share a feed of these things. I would like to dedicate another portion of the site to people that are selling thier products and want a community that is interested in fashion to be able to buy directly from my site. The purchases will only be able to be made by members and when they purchase something I would like it to show on thier page what they bought and who it was by so that not only does the buyer get to show off thier new item but it is free advertising for the seller. I will charge the sellers monthly to sell on the site. In addition to those things I want a tab for job postings. There will be a charge to the employer but the application process will be free to job seekers. I want the job seeker to be able to post a resume, portfolio, and cover letter. The job seeker may also chose to make thier fashionconnect profile public to employers. On the main page of the site I would also like to feature monthly contests, polls, fashion news, events, and an area where I will create a topic where all members can reply and blog it out. I know that this site is going to be very complex and I do have investors that are ready to fund the project to get it where it needs to be. This is only an outline of ideas and I hope that we can work together to make this dream a reality.','status' => '2','datestamp' => '1350675922','followup' => '0','packet' => '1','call' => '1','user_id' => '12'),

Good day.

I took the liberty of contacting you through your webform because I have 
something very important to share with you. So many web design companies are 
going broke at the moment by making some deadly mistakes. I wanted to be 
sure you are not one of them and give you some tips on how to avoid these 
mistakes!

We covered things I know you\\\'ll find interesting like \\"How to stop being the 
free support hotline for your clients!\\" We\\\'ve combined years of our own research 
with government statistics to come up with this report that I want to share with 
you for FREE.

love to hear about how useful you find it and any other questions you have!

I am working a concept that will require a basic social network development but heavy visual and image design, with social integration. So, forgive me if I\\\'m really detailed in this but I want to make sure you all understand just how I\\\'m envisioning this.

\\"Nebula\\" will be the first ever website dedicated to archiving news and current events, but with a social networking twist. I want to see how the public perception morphs and changes over time in regards to current events and how they are portrayed in the media. This will also help determine how the media alters public perception of current events.

In doing this, media outlets and bloggers can see how the public generally receives their articles, acquire stats and feedback, and learn which subjects really are of the greatest interest to their target audience. Nebula will also work to keep the media honest by opening up a platform for transparent criticism and input regarding their coverage.

The design for this website is rather intricate and will be visually stunning if done properly. Like its name, Nebula\\\'s visuals would resemble outer-space. Each news topic would appear as a nebula or galaxy (cluster of stars). Clicking on the nebula would zoom into the cluster of stars, with each news article being represented by an individual star. The colors and size of that nebula would depend upon the public feedback for each news article it contains.

For example, there could be a nebula specifically representing the 2012 Elections. If a person clicks on that nebula, they would zoom in and can see all of the news articles the site has collected regarding that subject. Members would be able to click on the star and bring up the corresponding news article to read it.

After reading the news article, the person can select from a drop down menu how they feel after reading (ex. angry, sad, happy, excited, indifferent, etc) and they can leave a comment. Each emotion in the drop down menu is connected to a color and the result would be that the star would progressively change its light\\\'s color in connection to reader feedback.

In this manner, each nebula would be unique, visually appealing and informative. As time progresses, new nebula can be formed but the public can always go back in time to research old topics.

Membership would allow people to select and watch favorite nebula, track their comments, and keep up to date on current events about topics that interest them.

I would like to discuss this project further with you, explain more about it and receive some feedback. I would also like to receive a pretty honest quote for what it would take to complete this project. Please give me an email so that we can discuss this further!

Bauer','email' => 'dbauer0284@gmail.com','company' => 'Socialreach.co','phone' => '3085392289','url' => '','service' => 'Network','budget' => '$10,000 - $30,000','idea' => 'Referred From:  - SocialReach.co has a simple goal, making it easier to acquire life, business, and career changing connections. SocialReach will allow individuals to interact with friends as well as reach out to new people with common interests and help them in their job search.  It would give businesses the ability to reach customers, and employees, as well as reach potential new hires. For example, if you had just moved to a new city and wanted to meet new people, you would be able to \\"meet\\" people with similar common interest (by what each individual has indicated on their \\"interests\\" section, that are open to meeting new people, and also group pages about similar interests taking new members.  If, however, that person/group is not interested in meeting/adding new people they can show that on their profile and they won\\\'t come up as a recommendation.
 Another example of the business connection would be, if you had started a band and are looking for local venues, you would be able to flag your bands\\\' page as looking for work. Local venues can then contact you. If, however, you were a local venue looking for talent, bands could contact you as well. 
SocialReach would still have many features of current social networks such as posting statuses, pictures, and links, but would also allow users to post open invitations to friends to come to events with them, and post a 1-5 star review about recent things they have done or places they\\\'ve been and many more. 
I feel this site would apply to people looking to expand their social circles, as well as businesses trying to generate revenue by creating and hosting events to bring in new customers and keep their business in the minds of their current and potential customers. A community calendar of sorts would be on the news feed sidebar to remind people of what is currently going on. Allowing businesses to run contests for people who have followed their page would help get the businesses advertising, or by allowing ad space for local advertisements on the right side of the page that would pertain to their area.  A search on the site could also list events in other areas that people would be interested in attending while in another city, or would plan a road trip to.
Tagging the business or event in a photo would allow the photo to be shared on the page in a general photo album thus allowing others who went to the same event to tag themselves or transfer pictures to their profile which would give the event even more publicity.
I would like to give each non-personal page type their own format, such as a format for \\"buy/sell pages\\" often seen on Facebook, band pages that focus more on their tour schedules and music, and another template for companies and businesses who would focus on new products and services. 
At this point my budget is not set, as I am looking for a ball park estimate. I don\\\'t want to divulge all of my ideas quite yet, but if you require more information to give me an accurate quote I can answer any questions you have. Email contact works best for me, thank you for reviewing my proposal.

Users are given cloud space to upload their media (music, video, text, & photo) and share their content with the world.   Initially We would like users to be able to upload media from both desktops and mobile devices.  

Custom CMS Mini-Sites
Users will also have the ability to create webpages from CMS templates where they can pick and choose the specific media they want to display from their cloud space in a quick and easy manner.  

Sharing
Users should have the ability to create pre-set triggers that share the custom mini-sites with a predetermined list of people.  Additionally, clients should have the ability to give limited administrative access to their account to authorized 3rd-parties.

Social Networking App similar to Twitter consisting of:
1) Posting status updates
2) Searching nearby status updates
3) initiating chats

1) Members would post status updates
2) Members could only view status updates near their proximity

1) Members could follow(subscribe)/Comment/Like other member\\\'s status updates
2) Members could initiate a chatroom with other members

www.Luvhan.com is a prototype of the App
and is built upon Wordpress/Buddypress

Luvhan will basically be Twitter
that only shows nearby tweets
and you can initiate chats

I have uploaded a basic App Wireframe

I have been seriously thinking about a social networking idea which will target a specific audience rather than creating something general. I have a web design in mind which has been translated onto paper. Therefore, I need someone to help me develop the website/social network since I do not have any programming experience. These are some of the features that I am looking to add onto the social network:

1. User ability to upload content.
2. User ability to have chat with other users
3. Ability for user to create and manage groups
4. Ability for user to upload documents onto website 
5. Ability to have webcam chats with other users
6. Ability to allow recruiters to post jobs 
7. Ability for users to upload pictures

*It would be ideal to create this social network to support unlimited members. I will also need some guidance in setting up servers. Basically, anything that needs to be done to have a site up and running. As I said before, I drew, on paper, the design of the social network which includes all pages. I am also in the process of creating all the rules (use cases) associated with what happens when any tab is clicked. I am looking to make part of this a paid member social network, and part for free. I am looking forward to your reply.

I saw that your company did exceptional website development work and I was hoping you could provide me with a rough quote for a Social Media Website I hope to launch in the next six months.

The website is called Story Shelter and will be a unique format for users to tell their life stories and read others, and also have an interesting component of optional anonymity.

I would be happy to share more in detail with you after signing a mutual NDA.

Right now I am trying to get a sense for how much this will cost to build and maintain so that I can better develop my business plan.  Though I could likely find a programmer to do this for less than hiring an experienced company,  I would prefer to utilize the expertise of a person/company that can not only build the site but also help me understand the potential for monetization and work with me to develop a cohesive plan for making the site a success.  

I know you will likely want an idea of my budget but it is hard to determine without knowing the timeline and potential for revenue. I\\\'d love to build it for as low as 10k but realize it may cost up to 100k.  My budget for the time being is somewhere in between, until I can get a better sense for the whole plan.  I have one VC interested in funding, though his contribution will depend upon the strength of the pitch and estimated return.

If this is something your company would consider working on, I would love to discuss in further detail.  I am also in Manhattan.

Best,

It is called BIZEB (read as busy bee). The idea came to me when looking at a picture of a honeycomb shape (hexagonal). I realised that this honeycomb network might be adapted as a concept for a social media network for professionals that visually represents their contacts list. The concept also relies on content marketing strategy whereby it is argued that it is far more effective to engage with ones industry by starting discussions with valuable, thought leading content, than to hard sell a concept or product. For users the network would include a profile and the ability to blog exclusively to their network.
This concept is still pretty thin on the ground and I am looking for a partner to help develop and then build the concept. I would require a quote in order to then go back to investors with a clear business plan and funding target.
I did contact your company before but was a bit too shy of making a fool of myself and did not respond to your follow up e-mail. I realise this was a mistake and want to move my idea forward. Please do get in touch.

However I am worried by the demos in the portfolio and the 10k-100k+ budgets for such sites. 

I really have not been looking much b ut from what I have seen the software called \\"Social Engine\\" has looked the best to me. I am very interested in having profiles that have the tabs at the top for things like \\"Vehicle Info\\" or \\"Bio\\". I also am looking for a much better blog system than is available with social engine. With Social engine I like the option to have certain pages viewed as a pintrest style. 

My extreme worry is that I have heard Social Engine is finneky . and does not support more than 3k people at one time. I would like to be able to have 10k members with the availibility to have atleast 1k active with room for improvment. 

Things I would like to see are: 
A very in depth profiling system that can have free member with no profile features along with say 7 different tiers of member that can each have their own membership price from free to X amount anually.. also each acc be able to view different \\"tabs\\" on a users profile. 
A blog that allows a homepage open view where blogs show fully, and a pintrest view that can be viewed by region (NW, E, S, SE, Japan, Australia exc exc) 
A backend that will not be hacked easily, and very stable to handle the traffic we will eventually see. 

My budget is far under $10k however I know you pay for quality and I am willing to see what you can do for me! I would like to have my website launched by April.. 

I thank you very much for your time, and look forward to your response!
Best Regards,
Jesse Vieira
